"Habitica has been a massive positive push in my life. I dont make alot of game reviews, but i kinda felt like i had to for this one. I have adhd and it mainly affects my executive function which gives me alot of issues with procrastinating and putting things off and letting things like my personal hygiene and im ashamed to admit this, but the care for my animals go. Having a place to manage all that with an immediate repercussion, even if digital has been a wonderful motivator",Bugs
"My settings kept on changing ever time I reopen the app. For example, fear is set to zero, when I open the app again, fear is set to 80. Why? Please fix this. It's getting tiresome to re-do the settings over and over.",Crashes
"I've been wanting a habit tracker that is fun and this definitely is. There are a few loading issues every so often, if those bugs weren't there I'd give 5 stars. All around though enjoyable, easy to use, and a great way to keep track of good and bad habits.",Bugs
Sync is a bit slow. Widget does not update very quickly either. Otherwise smooth interface and no other issues.,Bugs
Why this app consumes so MUCH traffic in background? This month it hit the 500mb (!!!) in bg. Is this app free of malware elements?,Other
Amazing app.. One request from the developers.. This app is turning humans into better humans so 'the rouge' class should be renamed to 'the Ninja' or something as it affects the subconscious brain of users without even them noticing it..(this pure psychology) And this is how low of attraction works.. Never talk or think of things which you don't want in life.. You yourself would not want anyone to be Rouge. So please give 'ROUGE' SOME positive polish.. If you can. Only a humble suggestion.,Praises
"If you don't allow access to the contacts you can't use the app. REALLY??? NO app, I repeat NO APP needs access to contacts to run. My contacts are private and none of your business. I've denied access on every single app that asks for it and they all run fine. You apparently are too persistent for reasons I can't see... uninstalled on the spot. Let me know when you reconsider your requirements.",Complaints
"Have only used the app a little while, not to bad for basic tasks. To bad you can't do lots of tasks unless you buy the premium version. It's an easy app to use",Complaints
Will not let me register. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Tried both the email login and the Facebook login.,Complaints
I purchsed it in order to use projects and subtasks.  Disappointed to see its just tasks under projects and doesnt really have subtasis at all.  How do I cancel my subscription?,Other

I love the widget but whenever I edit an event on the calendar it changes the day to like the day before without me doing so and it's extremely annoying,Crashes
Widget out of memory,Other
"Could be good if basic features like icons weren't locked behind a paid subscription. Update: your calling THEMES an advanced feature because you want to not because it is one.... Sorry but changing the background color to black, which it should be in the first place isn't an advanced feature, it's about one line of code. I'm a software engineer myself and know the difference between the two. Same goes for icons which are essentially to app functionality. Check out Notion for a great example.",Crashes
I liked this app BUT stop deleting events I add on. I can't keep re-adding events every hour. I'm getting frustrated and will have to uninstall unless it's corrected.,Complaints
It's been 1 week since I'm using the app. The reminder system worked fine for 1day and from next day the reminder system stopped functioning. Really disappointed. May be uninstalling the app after few days. Hope this helps.,Praises
"This app doesnt require your firstborn in order to function as similar apps do. The Quick post function is great. However, unlike other similar apps, this doesnt have a widget feature to show what the upcoming daily task is on the screen. So for me, that is really unfortunate. If this changes, I will gladly give this a perfect rating.",Crashes
Keeps on crashing :(,Crashes
"When I modify the tasks online they don't automatically sync in the phone Because of this problem I forget about a task I had to do It can't sync with google calendar For the rest, it's very well done and very nice",Bugs
"I can't set my time the same time I write up a task. I always have to save then revisit and set the time, which is very annoying. Also I can't upgrade to the premium version which is very disappointing. Overall not a bad app but there are a few things that need to be tweaked",Complaints
"Used to use this app, stopped for a few months, then came back to find that the app had been completely changed and that ll of my routines, tags, etc...had been wiped out. I'm pretty disappointed.",Crashes
I use it mainly for its widgets. ONE THING THOUGH: please fix the widgets so that the they show the current date and don't stay put on the previous day unless manually changed.,Crashes
"Easy to use and having most functions that I desire. Just one thing I would suggest: for the recurring tasks, it would be more useful if I mark completed this time but the app will remark it as an open task when it reaches half of the interval before next due date. Hope the smart developer can make it works like this way soon. Good luck! ☺",Praises
I kinda love this app but the only problem that I've face now is that i want to have my task on my pc and i think it would be great if you could put some accounts so that we can easily sort our task in any devices that we are into,Bugs
"Does what it's supposed to, one time charge for premium (which is still pretty basic...) I wish there was a was to make the list view more compact, visually hard to scan over the list. Also a custom order option would be great.",Praises
"I don't get task notifications anymore!!! This app has become useless. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, turned on / allowed notifications in the settings yet nothing.",Complaints
"Worthless, uninstalled after 2min what is the point of adding my schedule and goals without having a reminder!! This is the basic goal of the app you can't make it premium just make the full app with subscriptions instead of scamming people to have more downloads",Complaints
"Good app. I agree with other reviews, the addition of tasks will make it great. Update: The new edition seems to be less useful. It seems one need the pro version to get it to work well. revised update. The app is very useful to ser in one vie appointments highly recommended",Praises
Update killed it a few months ago. The notes were all wrongly ordered. Pointed out the issues to the developer 1.5 months ago but no fix till date. Giving up on this app.,Bugs
After updating ..the app is crashing ..its not working,Crashes
"Note icons issue is fixed. Shared lists are not syncing properly. When completing an item from the owner list, it doesn't get completed on a shared users list. But if a shared user checks an item is complete it IS checked as complete on the owners list. The sync is broken.",Bugs

"Desktop and web version is slow, awkward, and useless. App for phone is good. As soon as I have time, I will switch to something else. Makes me miss Wunderlist",Complaints
"New UI design is amazing! Only one mistake... when I edit a task, the save button is not showing but I can click that...look into it. Edit: Its fixed now already, Thank you :)",Praises
Loved it untill recently when it started playing adds eveytime i put in an appointment. Now ill have to get a new calender app after years of using it and loving it. Too bad.,Praises
Way too expensive for the premium features. While I don't mind paying for an app there are many other apps that track to-do items for far less money,Other
"A great app that helps create new habits or break bad habits. If you want to set goals, this is the app to use. Tried many of the same type of apps and this is, by far, the best & easiest to use.",Praises
It would be better if there are more options for customising the avatar and theme which is in purple. You will need to spend money for a decent background. The avatar is pixelated and doesn't look good. Getting a bit bored of it now.,Other
Very nice setup. Thought enough of it to pay for premium. Couple things - add ability to change watch hand colors (arms match scheduled event making it impossible to see) - add ability to increase watch face inner diameter digital time (difficult to read). Watch = Ticwatch Pro 4g Phone = Moto Z3 w/Pie,Crashes
Great! Get it!,Praises
Uninstalled. Couldn't get it to register. Disappointed,Complaints
Please add start view that has many favorite projects easily accessible. Would be better if it was possible to add top of the list. It is not easy to use with one hand since everything is in the top left corner (please add material design button for favorite projects to bottom). Lists do not automatically sort and sort needs to be done again if anything is changed.,Crashes
"I just started using this. One thing I would like to see is the ability to add check boxes to an event. For example I have a time slot labeled housework scheduled from 11am to 12pm. I would like to be able to tap on that block of time and see that I need to do dishes, vaccume, and dust in that time frame, and be able to mark off each task as it is complete.",Other
"Worked fine for months, now it doesn't track habits the way I set them. It treats every day as its own success or failure regardless of how I have set it up. Going to have to uninstall and find a new habit tracking app.",Complaints
"very nice app, but there are a few bugs with the widget not really updating to the correct data e.g. - if you put the widget on home screen, change the name of the tasks list, it doesn't update",Bugs
Went for the premium subscription without a doubt. Definitely benefitial to those to use it honestly. Edit: Everything's good but after changing phones I've suffered having to manually copy the same habit list because the sync function just doesn't work.,Crashes
not bad,Complaints
App kept on crashing. I had to delete and download the app three times this week alone. I love the app. It has been very helpful. But this issue has been very annoying,Bugs
"This new planner pro for which I paid for life is poorer than the previous version. I take ages to open, does not immediatly delete bring not all old tasks forward. Very bad.",Complaints
Very good app for keeping records of your habits.,Other
"Good app but it would be great if we could add categories of our own..also some more widgets would be useful..such as one for tasks and for a single habit,etc..and it would be awesome if there was like a sharing board..to share our progress with other users if the app and compete with friends in a group and be accountable for each other..it would be reallly helpful in the habit forming process.. Love your app..Please consider these changes..",Crashes
"I've been switching between task apps for years, this seems the most intuitive and allows me to be the most productive. Quite a few features are paid for though, and although I would be willing to pay a larger upfront fee, a monthly fee isn't a commitment I'd be willing to make",Other
How do to stop monthly payment because i don't use this app anymore,Other
"Absolutely refuses to not sync data with Google account. If I try to use a Gmail sign in I HAVE to sync everything with Google. The app will ask 500 times in a row regardless of how many times I hit ""deny"". Makes the entire app totally unusable. Changing emails is a massive pain in the ass if you already have a Google account associated with it. This is absolute garbage.",Crashes
"Great app! I suggest a timer on this one, so we can still track our rest periods every time we take a short rest.",Praises
"Beautiful interface but it is very annoying to navigate and not fluid. Creating reoccurring tasks seems to be a pain. Not sure if it's me or the app, but I kept having to change the time 2-3 times to get the correct times reoccurence. Grocery list is awesome. The calendar looks like Google calendar which is nice but it is choppy to navigate.",Crashes
Excellent app.,Praises

Keeping me on top of stuff! Love the colors!,Praises
It was a meh app. Good for a while and then the server crash. I cant even login anymore. I already purchased the premium version but cannot use it anymore. So sad to say this but i really regreted buying the premium version. Bye dev.,Crashes
I have an issue of widget stretching. Are there any debugs?,Bugs
Really like it. Would love to be able to manually resize appointments and add new appointments into arcs with free time.,Praises
Great app. New update doesn't allow me to restore my pro status for some reason. Keeps saying I need to log out of other Google accounts but I only have my one Google account.,Praises
One of the main bugs in this app is that the widget's time doesn't update on its own. And the time gets stuck at any point.,Bugs
I'm sure this would be a great app... if you could actually use it. But it only allows you do add things from another calendar making it useless if you don't have one.,Praises
Too slow and clunky. Especially with signup,Complaints
Widget is slow,Complaints
"I found this app to be redundant, since I already have a calendar on my phone, and Planner Pro does little else.",Other
It doesnt update between your calanders. I need a planner that stays up to date with my calendar changes. This is not it.  Waste of money.,Crashes
"Used to love it, now it's been an issue after issue with this app. You'd expect that it would perform at least the basic task of reading my calendars. Doesn't even do that anymore, no matter how many times I try to sync it. So much for getting the ""premium"" version. Disappointing.",Bugs
"The setup seemed nice, but the constant pop ups are so annoying as to make it unusable",Complaints
"This app really changed my life. I was able to make my life work with this. I've been trying to get my life on track and out of depression, and this app showed me how. Now I am keeping my house clean, keeping up with my social life, doing homeschool with my kids, and keeping up with then 😊 I didn't think that was possible last year.",Crashes
"Medium. Would be better if everyone had the feature to create todos from flagged email in outlook. Without that, I don't need outlook on my phone.",Other
"The UI looks good but can be confusing. The different labels (programmer, etc.) don't make much sense in the context of the app. You can't check an item as 'done', and if something in your day changes and you need to adjust or reorder your routine for one day, you can't, which makes the app a bit useless.",Crashes
Even after your response it doesn't change the fact that you are required to have an account to proceed. The reasoning that others do it is negligible. Only way I would rate this app better is if you had an Anonymous auto log in that can be converted to a full account on sign up or log in.,Crashes
"Hello I just upgraded to your go pro within this free version but it looks like nothing changed.. How do I get those pro features? Where are the widgets? Do I have to install the Pro app? I have to buy it again if I did that, I've looked it up already. Please fix this. I have already refund your app.",Crashes
"While it has helped me be more productive, recently the notification settings are bugging out. When I tap on 'ADD notification', and select a louder notification (for when I wake up) and press done, I find out sooner or later than it had reset it to the ""opener"" (my default notification sound that is quiter). This has caused me great annoyance because of this and do not know why this app decided to bug out!",Bugs
"Looks really good, but unfortunately couldn't get to set a customized template...",Other
"One of the key premium features of this app is labeling, which unfortunately doesn't work properly. When I try to move a label to a shared section, the app crashes. Additionally there is an inconsistency between Android and iOS in how the labels work. In Android I can see the whole list of labels even without tasks, on iOS a label is deleted when there are no tasks marked with the label. This together makes sharing labeled tasks with my wife really annoying",Crashes
Easy to use,Other

"Very good app for tracking habits and notes to add ,but lots of bugs to say.Percentage is not correct always,it calculates own and no sync, no UI improvement .thanks",Bugs
The invite user feature is horrible. You can only do it through email as the text option doesn't work. I used to be able to select a user in the app and they would be notified in the app. I was a user of Wunderlist and this is a step backwards as far as I can tell.,Other
Good app. Very nice. But is confusing. I do not understand anything. But no problem. I will learn. Then this is a good app.,Bugs
The app sends too many notifications with annoying sound 😡,Complaints
This app looked good until I had to purchase it just to get the week view. Now everytime I choose week view it crashes and stops working! I want a refund or a fix!,Crashes
"Not working fully, I was wondering what happened to the reminder I set. It only notified me (of an event already passed) when I opened the app, what use is that? *Edit, dev telling me I'm ignoring faq, I can't find that when looking at the app on the play store.",Complaints
"When I first installed the app, it worked well. However, recently I started getting notifications at incorrect times (out by several hours). I have not changed anything since I set it up a few months ago. This app is pretty much useless now.",Crashes
good app...but they could add something like notification bar tab or floating widget or something so as to remind us constantly to keep us in check in order to develop out habits,Other
"Hi I really enjoy and appreciate this app. As a mobile app it works perfectly for me, however I'd really appreciate a computer version that can sync with it. I'm not sure if this exists already? I like that the app is on my phone so that i can constantly check my schedule anywhere - any time, however when I feel the need to adapt and change my schedule, it feels a little cluttered and time consuming. I frequently feel the urge to open it up on my computer as it is easier to work with this interface given the larger screen and increased capability. Please consider this in future upgrades, Regards,",Crashes
Easy to use and does the job in an easy user friendly format.,Other
"I like it, also I would like, like a wedget but for the block screen. Then you don't need to open the phone, only activate the screen in order to see the next task in your calendar",Other
"This app worked well at first, but it kept altering my entries no matter how many times I changed them. Not sure if it's a problem just with syncing accounts.",Bugs
"There seems to be a bug with the latest version where all new items have the note icon showing. Please fix, it's annoying.",Bugs
I really can't change notification sound and it uses the same phone notification.,Crashes
I have been using this application for 1 week. I am giving five stars to this application because after downloading this application I am getting my work done on time.

"So far, I love this app and the idea behind it. It holds me accountable for my tasks and habits which i really love. I would totally give it a shot.",Praises
"A decent app for its intents and purposes but I struggle to stay invested. It's visually good, great icons and colours, also has a nice selection of skills. My biggest issue is the navigation. I can't immediately see or twirl down to see subtasks. Actually marking something as done, especially subtasks is a challenge - mostly because you face to keep tapping through the task and pages of info to get there. Perhaps a mind map or something would make it easier.",Bugs
"Love the new UI. Before, you can't look at tasks when offline. It's fixed now. You can also filter the tags.",Praises
"I've been trying to figure out how to have a custom time set for the ""add notification"" options, and there doesn't seem to be any way. For example, I need to set it to 1 hour and 30 minutes, but there's no option for that. We need the ability to enter exactly the number of minutes and hours we want, instead of only having presets.  EDIT: Now after using it for a while, the app has been plagued with reliability issues. It often is late with the notification by a few minutes, or the service completely stops and I'd have to restart the service. Due to this issue, I cannot rely on this app for anything that is time-sensitive because I'd end up being late for all my appointments and jobs. I've contacted the developer multiple times about this but so far they haven't been able to fix the issue.",Bugs
"Seems like it could be fun, I just had a hard time getting into it.",Praises
"So much potential. Still learning but loving it. CON: when tasks go to Notification Bar I have option to mark Complete or Snooze. When I tap on either, it freezes my phone for up to 10 to 12 secs. Sometimes get UI isn't responding. WHY?",Crashes
Amazing App!!! But still you guys need make a lot of changes in UI for eg: I am unable to decide how much coins should i get with one positive And all task should reset at a specified time by user,Crashes

"I really have loved this app but it has lately been bugging out on me, even though it is up to date. It won't let me view certain days at all, it will just take me to the day before or the same date in a different month if I try clicking on it. It only started for the past week or two.",Bugs
Nice app. Bug with achievement exp gained. It only adds on to current hero exp without leveling up eg( 144exp/25exp ). Why does skill decay even after doing a task that increases it?,Bugs

I have basically stopped using it except as a calendar, but it's so slow it's not even efficient to be used for that.",Complaints

I had been saving up and watching extra ads for coins for weeks, and then found there was nothing I wanted to spend those coins on.

"Very nice app with a bad drawback: today's repetition for a recurring task will not appear unless I mark yesterday's task as done! Here's how this is very bad for me:  - I have many recurring daily tasks, and it's a very tedious job to mark all my recurring tasks as done, even those that were NOT done! It gets much worse if I don't use the app for a few days! Then I have to mark all recurring tasks as done for every and each previous day!!!!  - The app forces me to record false information! A task that was not done on a specific day, should stay there as NOT done, and the recurring task should be generated for the following day.  - You have only 3 options for a recurring task: 1) to mark it as done in order for it to appear on the following day. 2) not to mark it as done, and it will never ""recur""! 3) to delete, and it disappears, and naturally, it will never ""recur""!  A recurring task should recur, regardless of marking or not marking the previous repetition as done!",Complaints

"I've been using Habitica for a few years now and while I love the idea, from a technical standpoint the mobile app is broken. It feels like something you would have on your phone back when touchscreens were a new thing.

Why so many overlapping lists? 3. You can't change fixed time for reminder alarm. For example, ""tomorrow"" is always at 9 a.m. You can't change that to, say, 10 a.m. 4. You can't set quick alarm. For example you can't type some note and then tap ""remind me in half an hour"" or in 15 minutes, in two hours etc. There's no such option. 5.

"I really like this app, the layout, and ease of use. It's the only habit tracker I find myself using and looking forward to utilizing. Great features and interface. It has everything I expect from an app of its kind to help keep me accountable. Also, the app is well maintained with timely updates and improvements. SideNote: The Developer made good on adding that frequencies change feature. Thanks Developers. .👍🏼",Crashes

"Ads are becoming really invasive and you have to wait at least 5s each time before you can skip, see another ad, then come back to the calendar. Not inclined to buy pro with such bad user experience... Edit : And most people use a calendar app once or twice a day, so I guess dev are aiming for maximum ad visibility... I know nothing is free but this is annoying, and it's video ads for silly games. I guess I'll uninstall soon..",Complaints
Awesome app. Love that I can choose themes too,Praises
"I have used this app for years, it is great if you want to be more organized and get reminders of the tasks you need to do. I must say however, that the app itself has regressed throughout the years with all the updates. Things used to be simple and intuitive, now I don't understand what half the buttons do, basic functions like deleting and removing tasks are way too clunky. The concept of the app is great but I can't recommend it anymore, each update makes it worse.",Praises
"The app's good but after the update I'm having issues like the app's not recording the info after the completion of the timer, it just crashes and starts from the beginning.",Bugs

Just an idea id be up for.",Praises
This app is useful. BUT. It would be so much more useful if you could set a routine to be repeated every weekday/ weekend day/ week/2week/4week/month/etc. It is badly in need of this feature. I thought buying pro would allow me to do this and it hasn't helped at all and I'm disappointed I spent the money. Please say that it is an upcoming feature. Resetting routines for every day is really inconvenient!,Complaints

I really enjoy this app but it has just stopped working randomly. I tried to hatch a dragon egg and the app crashed and since then I cant access it.

I am very dissapointed as I really like the idea of the app.,Crashes
"My rating to this app just dropped from 5⭐ to 1⭐ mainly because of this company's marketing strategy on how to pressure someone or the previous users to buy their pro version. There were many beautiful trees in store where you can purchase for free with free version. Now, it's only possible by having the pro version. It's quite disappointing that this app doesn't allow you to feel motivated and pull you down by offering their worst trees masterpiece. I won't give my 5 ⭐ till this issue FIXED!",Bugs
"Used the free version for years, no issues, didn't need the pro features. Then they started putting in ads - not the kind that pop up along the bottom but ones that completely hijack the screen while you're trying to work. Worst bait-and-switch I've ever seen.",Bugs
The one thing I don't like is the alarm. Can't shut off without losing the event.,Other
"Ads that completely take over your phone & have a forced timer so you can't exit out of them. - EDIT - It's untrue what the developer says regarding ads appearing once every 18 hours, it is more frequent. The ""skip"" the developer is referring to is NOT instantly available, you must wait a timer out. - It wouldn't be a problem if the ads weren't so disruptive, they literally take over your screen. I have no problem with small less annoying ads.",Bugs

"I've been trying to figure out how to have a custom time set for the ""add notification"" options, and there doesn't seem to be any way. For example, I need to set it to 1 hour and 30 minutes, but there's no option for that. We need the ability to enter exactly the number of minutes and hours we want, instead of only having presets.  EDIT: Now after using it for a while, the app has been plagued with reliability issues. It often is late with the notification by a few minutes, or the service completely stops and I'd have to restart the service. Due to this issue, I cannot rely on this app for anything that is time-sensitive because I'd end up being late for all my appointments and jobs. I've contacted the developer multiple times about this but so far they haven't been able to fix the issue.",Bugs
"I really like the app, but I would enjoy it more if there was the ability to manually order tasks through simple drag and drop like in LifeRPG. Also, if there was a quicker way to edit like in Life RPG that would be great. I would be willing to pay as a way of supporting you guys, but right now LifeRPG is more practical and they'll get my money until you catch up. Love the decreasing skills btw :)",Praises

Its a good app for everyday tasks. It takes time to customize it and its normal because its an RPG type. However I think im not the only one who encountered this annoying bug where if you want to change a task from lets say termless to always repeat every day the task remains termless. You can solve this problem by deleting the task and making another with the setting you want. This bug was very frustrating because i thought i did something wrong but yeah..,Bugs

This app has a fantastic concept that being an MMO style game based around your success in real life. The game is entirely server based and I have a good internet connection but the app would constantly disconnect. I would like a single player mode of some sort no need for like a story or something just something to see your effects in game. So because of the insane amount of server issues I have experienced just using the app for a little but I could not recommend this which is a shame.,Bugs

Reminders for things I have set daily don't even come up anymore, but it remembers to give me an display-over-app notification to remind me to set a reminder. Also, no push notifications that take you into the app so you'd have to do it yourself. Sub-tasks are my favourite feature!",Complaints

Not only that, but if you miss checking a box but don't see that omission until the next day, there's nothing you can do about it. Maybe the fatal flaw of this app is that it has too many features for its own good. I'd like to get rid of sync entirely and just use the app on my Android, but apparently that can't be done, and if I delete my online account I delete everything. I think I just want to dump this flawed app and see if I can find a good app that does everything offline in one device with no registration required.",Bugs

It also will not sound when I have reminders set for many different times.

"I bought the pro version and like it so far. For now what I'm really missing is the ability to change days from the widget itself, with the left and right arrows, and not only from inside the app. Why wouldn't you enable the left and right arrows to change day as default? Having to go into the app to review past or coming days defeats the purpose of the widget, and forces you to use something else other than the widget itself. Other than that, the app seems to be very practical. If the ability to swipe from one day to the next day or to the last day from the widget gets implemented, it would be a 5 star app for me.

"Excellent idea but poor execution. There really isn't much to do game wise 
especially since the majority of the content is locked behind a paywall. I 
understand that they have to monetize it but at 1 million users, ad 
impressions may have been a better route instead of a subscription service 
that locks out the majority of your player base from the start. There's 
also no way to earn crystals other than paying. With so little to do and so 
much unavailable unless you pay (with no options to try before you buy) 
gives me little motivation to come back. Some advice: ●Make the quests you 
can buy with gold cheaper. 200 coins takes forever to grind and there's not 
much to do otherwise. ● Have a way for f2p players to earn crystals (maybe 
through daily login bonuses, level up bonuses or grind and buy them with 
gold). ●Offline capabilities especially for checklists and tasks. I 
shouldn't need the internet to check off my to do list. ●Have the ability 
to choose your class at the start and allow players to change class 
whenever they'd like. Having to wait until you're level 10 is too much of a 
grind. ●Have a little more customization available from the start (maybe a 
freeby starter egg or a background or outfit). Literally everything is 
locked behind crystal pay walls...even the character backgrounds are a 
whopping 15 crystals . That just screams greedy.",Crashes

Allowed subtasks to renew as collapsible tasks not just tied in 2. Made tutorial/videos. Full functionality will be a learning curve for many",Bugs
helpful with notes and events. no restrictions to enter everything like appointments,Other
"Seems good so far. I might rate it higher after using it for longer but the annoying pop up messages forced me to either say I didn't like it or rate it now... EDIT: to reply to the response. There was only the option to review now or say I didn't like it. I would have picked review later if that was there. EDIT 2: Thanks for taking my suggestion on board, I will update this review and rating once I have used the app more 👍",Complaints

"Alarms or notifications don't work unless you open the app, then it floods all the notifications for the tasks as i open the app. Defeats the purpose of the app. Tedious round-about way to delete a Habit compared to deleting a Task. Not sure how this app got a 4.6 rating.",Other

"I needed a replacement for Wunderlist, which we relied on for task lists for our business & employees. With TickTick, I had to manually type in each task for each list because the Import feature only put them in my Inbox. There's no Home Screen - hitting the return arrow exits the app (not a biggie, just an adjustment). The real downer is having to pay to share the lists with more than one person. Collaboration was an important feature we needed. Using Microsoft's To Do for now.",Other

Great for task managing and motivation if you like games and collecting things! :) There are a couple of bugs though, and the app does not support some of the features available in the web version which i find a bit odd.

"I wouldn't have given such a low rate if it wasn't for my honest disappointment, and I promise to change to 5 starts the moment I'm reassured that things got better. This concept is amazing, and the idea is just brilliant. However, this is by far the buggiest app I've ever had on my Android, and the UI is just not well thought of. Guys, please work on the bugs so I won't have to click 1,000 times before I get feedback that something happened, won't have to reopen the app and lose all the initial welcome tour with all the choices, won't have to use my full name without being able to change it because I signed up with Google....

"Habitnow is the first todo list with a key feature I've been looking for: to-do items that are automatically created at certain times. As such it is the best such app I've ever used. The only problem is that the author made no provision for hiding completed items. They just hang around cluttering the list--the best it does is move them to the bottom. I find it very odd that anyone would want to stare at completed to-do items. Certainly that shouldn't be the default, but there it is.",Bugs
So far so good. I love creating my own adventure. Still learning some of the functions. Maybe a tips video could help. I can't wait to see what other fun things can be added.

Bring the Gantt view,Other
This is a great app with one major downfall. The completed tasks are removed from the list and can only be accessed after a lot of clicks. By default it should stay on the list in a striked out state. It is important to know the tasks which I completed on the day. Hope this is fixed soon.,Praises
"It was good but I guess Google is sabotaging it, so I lost a couple of notifications. Removed it and started using Google calendar and notifications are now ok. Sorry.  I have uninstalled the program since I missed an important appointment I can no longer trust it.  Probably the solution you provide works, but I think it you should force the user to check those settings on start so one doesn't miss appointments.",Complaints

Same issue as Don Smith who wrote a review on 10/10/19. Will consider this app but the lack of slide visuals and character visuals makes the app in-op.

"Autofailed tasks should be more intuitive. They don't actually fail until you visit your task list, and if you failed them yesterday the points for the day you failed them don't go to that day, they go to the current day. So because I slacked off yesterday, I'm starting today with like -20 gold on my chart! That's not fair and it skews the stats. If I didn't do something yesterday, I want it to show that I didn't do something /yesterday/. And when I autofail a task it should alert me with a notification, or at least as soon as I open it to the home screen. And tasks should be able to be set to just autofail at midnight without having to fiddle with the current more involved settings.",Other

"The calendar should be able to set up recurring events easier. Updated: The calendar still makes it difficult to define a recurring date that occurs on the 3rd Monday, 1st Thursday, etc. It should be more intuitive. Also, it should allow you to define the event type better instead of just birthdays, anniversaries, etc. A custom event type that is user defined would be nice, like job anniversary, named day, National BBQ Day, etc. How do you import a list of holidays from a file (HTML,TXT,XML) ?",Other

"Hearing other peoples experiences really ruins the app for me. I'm a pro user, I didn't know that all the trees were behind a pay wall now. But to make that change, it's really disappointing.

"The grocery list is not syncing properly and is missing items that my wife added on her phone. This has caused issues for us where I've missed items when shopping. This is particularly bad considering the current quarantine and the fact that I have to queue up to get into the shop in the first place. I've tested and when I add the item ""snacks"" on my wife's phone they don't appear on my grocery list. I can not recommend this app currently because of this.",Bugs

"The tasks don't show when I go to a particular date such as the next day. It says ""you have a free day"" even though all my tasks are set to daily( what is the difference between 'Daily' and 'Every Day' anyway?)

One thing that it should incorporate right away is the possibility of archiving Routines and Tags (not only keep or delete). I will rate 4 stars if they add this feature and 5 stars if they manage to make it a GREAT app for time scheduling.",Praises

"The description of this app says it supports tasks - but doesn't tell you it only works in the paid version.  Tasks are the ONLY reason I downloaded, and I will not pay for an app when I can't try out a feature, first.  I feel like this developer has stolen my contact information now - very shady. Will not use this or any of their other apps.  Uninstalling, with a vengeance.  Going back to Google calendar and Google Keep, and will continue to look for an app that works like those two google apps in an integrated single app...or works similar tor Microsoft Outlook.",Complaints
"The interface is great and I love it overall; however, I'm giving it two Stars because it won't synchronize between my Samsung phone and Ipad, despite being the same account information for each. I emailed their support like about this, and they asked for my login info, but I never heard anything back. This is a huge inconvenience because I put a LOT into the version on my iPad, and I dont, and wont, do it twice for the same application. Once this is fixed I'll happily increase the rating.",Praises

"I used to do on my htc, it was ok. But I do not receive notifications on my redmi note 8 pro now. It is really bad thing.",Complaints
"I seriously don't understand. The basic functions of the app are so janky and broken. In the avatar creation, I had to keep pressing the options I wanted over and over for it to actually work, then when I finished the avatar had options I didn't pick. Every habit defaults to being both positive and negative. I know there has to be some default, but it's kind of weird that if I have a positive habit I have to tap the negative button. Adding tags is really clunky because the tags have to be added to the filter, (I guess it works but it's unintuitive to have to add a tag to the filter instead of just tagging the task itself) but when I add them they don't immediately get added. They disappear and then get added a few minutes later. Half the time it won't let me move around the tasks. Sometimes the FAQ text pops up overlaying whatever screen I'm on. Switching between habits, dailies, to-dos, and rewards is finicky. Sometimes swiping doesn't work, sometimes trading the icon doesn't work. I have to tap things in the equipment menu multiple times for them to work. Same for the avatar menu. With patience all this stuff does eventually work, but it's tedious to just use the app. The app would be 10 times better just by fixing the buggy menus",Bugs

"You can't see your whole week schedule on just one page, so if you wanted to schedule something with someone, you have to flip through each single day. Also when you create specific events, they aren't incorporated into your routine for a single period/cycle. They are two separate things. So you may get a notification about it beforehand, but when you look through your weeks schedule it doesnt show up there. It's great for routines, but doesn't incorpotate events into your week which is hard for scheduling.",Praises
"It is doing a strange black screen thing, and randomly opens by itself (other reviews have mentioned this) and I suspect it is making my phone crash. My phone is crashing several times a day, when I remove the app it stops crashing. I hope there is a fix for this. It works just fine on my tablet, but not my phone.

The ads on this app are cancerous and the subscription model for this type of app is ludicrous. Charge a single flat rate.  If the style does change to flat rate/ad free I'll gladly change my review.,Crashes
"I really like this app but it has some weird issues. Set as a widget, it'll list multiple events on the same day. Example; 3 or 4 entries as ""Independence Day"", & no way to delete them. Not linked to multi-accounts, shows all no matter what. Very frustrating. Other than that it's good for quick calendar entries, that's why it's staying. ***edit*** Going to ""settings -> appearance -> filter duplicate events"" gets rid of them. Just don't have muliltiple, exact same entries on the same date. 4* now",Bugs

"I really like the application so far. Great interface and feature set. I'd really like to see and would even do an inapp purchase for would be a much larger icon set. I think being able to group characteristics and skills would be awesome too. Even better if the group can collapse. It would also be cool to see a health bar that represents the amount of time you have in a day to be productive. Have it decrement as time passes and maybe make it adjustable for how much time you have in a day i think another tasklist app does that. Overall a great application, I hope you continue working on this application.  Edit: The app is still decent, but taking away the option to just remove ads for a one time price in favor of subscription only has made me decide to stop using this application and change my previous 5 star rating to a 2 star rating.",Crashes

I made one for Monday and it auto filled for every single day of the week, whereas I need them different and when I go to try and add a new task to my day that I want, it changes it for all of them. Disappointing and useless if theres no way to bypass that...might as well go back to pen and paper.",Crashes

"Sorry but the migration from Wunderlist made some things worse. The architecture stays the same and this is good but there are some things that are doubtful unfortunately. Why do I need to flag each task to make it appear on ""My Day"" ? If I assign a task for today, I want it to appear already in ""My Day"", otherwise what's the point of this ""My Day""? Not too many customization possibilities, the look of the app is a bit bulk and not so elegant. Some reminders are not working. I hope this can help",Complaints
App became unusable with 11/06/18 update. Now the app takes 30-45 to open up after I click it and then I'm get an annoying ad that plays that I can't close for another 5-10 seconds. I'll be finding a new calendar app.,Complaints

There were many beautiful trees in store where you can purchase for free with free version. Now, it's only possible by having the pro version. It's quite disappointing that this app doesn't allow you to feel motivated and pull you down by offering their worst trees masterpiece. I won't give my 5 ⭐ till this issue FIXED!",Bugs

"Its not a bad app at all, but it could be better. If you could keep track of how often you complete a task that would be better. Like if you checked off every time you shampooed your hair it would be nice to keep track so you can change how much you shampoo if needed. Also i feel like having a bar at the top to switch between lists makes more sense than the way it is now. You should still give it a try if you need something like this because you might like it better than i did.",Crashes
"Excellent customer service and very reasonable staff. They tried to reach me within a week, their responses were very clear and not once did they blame me for any issues I had run into.

I allowed everything for this app in my phone's settings but still no change. Disappointing since I used to love this app.",Crashes
"It's a good app to block your phone if you want to focus for some time. The thing is, it is not as good if what you want is to stop over-using your phone altogether. Also the last change of moving certain tree species (most of them, almost all) to premium is kind of lame, since so many functions are already only available for premium accounts. Couple that with how much time it takes to get a tree and this change seems unnecessary (since use time also means more adds watched and more revenue).",Crashes
"Really useful, it helps me organize and keep track of my daily tasks. I use To Do on both windows and android.

If the other option is the recommended one (which I hate that it adds an alarm icon in the status bar. other apps work without doing this), it doesn't mean the other one IS NOT WORKING. Bad.

But there seems to be a Bug - I can't seem to receive a friend's Party invite, though I am able to create my own party and invite friends to it. It's a one way street in my app! Joining guilds and the self-care, self-sabotage info have been most educational and helpful.",Bugs

Absolutely hated it it was just weird,Complaints
Helps me focus on my work but the downside is whenever I close my phone it takes 10 to 15 minutes and shuts down maybe this is because of my phone or something but nonetheless I enjoyed using it.,Praises
"This app is my saviour during quarantine. Now that I have a schedule, what's up next in the day, my anxiety level has gone way down. I'm so glad I downloaded this app. I love how on top of notifications there's a voice saying aloud to what's coming up. A minor issue is that ""reading"" is pronounced ""reding"". Great app.",Bugs
"It's a great app for focusing on whatever you do. When I open my phone, reading that little message immediately cause me to go back to my work. It really helps me to study for my exams, I'm used to using the app so much that whenever I set time I automatically get in the mood for studying and I start working efficiently.",Praises
Rather new to the app to rate it higher than a 3 at this time. But I like the results it is helping me to achieve. I expect improved time management as I get the app's feature set up to serve me best. I sense I may rate it higher as I experience it benefits more. I do like using it better then Wunderlist.,Other

I am a huge fan of Fantastical (on iOS) so I needed an app like it when I got an Android phone. I love the widget and I love the reminders feature! My only critique is I wish there was a simpler view for the monthly view. It's a little overwhelming to see it all the way it is right now. I like Fantastical's monthly view better.,Praises
its ok little confusing at first i think some more of the features that are in the add a blah should be a bit more clear. also a report a bug option would be nice my entire phone is on silent cause im at work app still makes sounds.,Bugs
My go to for years. Until the last update. Ads used to be unintrusive. Now you have to wait 10 seconds after every calendar update for the ad to run. Uninstalling now.,Complaints
Amazing App!!! But still you guys need make a lot of changes in UI for eg: I am unable to decide how much coins should i get with one positive And all task should reset at a specified time by user,Crashes
This app is really nice and makes me to build good habits but only thing is annoying in this app is you can't import more than 7 habits until you get premium.,Complaints

"This app was quite useful to have and something I think that I needed. The only thing that put me off was the 'premium '. It slightly ruins it so I would definitely make everything accessible to everyone if I would change something about this app. Other than that, quite handy little app that will probably make a difference to your day!",Crashes
"Despite various updates to ""fix bugs"" the first few screens of this app are still completely broken on Android. The app beyond sign-in still functions...but that's it. The game aspect is weak, the app isn't very well designed, and the tutorials tend to be broken on Android as well. I prefer apps like Fabulous, which I think approaches the subject of mental health and habit forming in a much better way.",Bugs
"I purchased the paid version and I'm sort of disappointed. Every time I enter a task it adds the first letter of the first word over again so I have to change it each time (i.e. it will autocorrect to EEvery instead of Every). It is also kind of laggy. It could be a great app, but not as is.",Crashes
"While in looks this app is lovely, it had a big issue for me, price. I am always looking for an android replacement for goodnotes (an ios exclusive app I use for digital planning). Visualy the app is beautiful and it seemed to be very well put together, but be willing to pay $40 a year (special price?) monthly $4.99. In the current state of peoples pandemic budget, personally I feel it's WAY to expensive. Heck Goodnotes is $10 once with updates, am I missing something? Happy Planner $20 even..",Bugs
When I put any task in a certain day it says that planner stopped and not working,Complaints
"The app is good and in general highly customizable, but it has one flaw: it uses days (24 hours periods) as a basic unit of measure, but it doesn't let you change the default starting hour (midnight). This is inconvenient for people who have unusual working hours and it makes the app impractical to track daily tasks for users who are more productive at night. I would rate it as a 5 stars app, if I could choose when my day ends and be able to log my dailies properly.",Crashes

"Would be better if the Inbox was not treated as a project, but rather a scheduling location, and that items could be created in the inbox and EASILY (bulk) moved to other projects (but stay in the inbox) to then be scheduled to daily or next week or whatever Tracking would be easier. and the app would get a higher rating and I may actually subscribe.. Its a deal breaker for me.",Complaints
"A bit underrated. It's a fun way to get things done, kind of like having a video game character. It does take time to set up and some unnecessary options cost money, but it makes getting stuff done feel more rewarding. Good app for parents to set up for their kids as well so they are more motivated and enjoy getting chores, homework, etc, done. :-)",Praises
Amazing,Praises
"Wish sync was fixed, it takes a lot of manual refreshing to do basic tasks such as refresh for the day or reload when you've died. UI could be better too. I wish there was slightly more focus on the social side of it. Also slow, unresponsive, and unreliable really. Good idea, but not great execution. Going to move on to a different app now after all this time.",Crashes

I also got notification pop-ups on my MacBook calendar app which seemed to sync itself with my Google calendar. I went to Google calendar to turn it off but it wouldn't let me. I had to delete all 10 emails, hide the notifications and now I will be uninstall this app. It should have an option to disable syncing. Nice idea. Lazy developers.",Complaints

"Task sections with a ""/” in their name get converted to ""_"". Almost perfect. A feature I'd love is if using share could predict the project you're adding to based on the app you're sharing from.

I wish after doing that a dozen times todoist would know that I like to add these links to my ""Music"" protect and preselect it for me.",Praises
It doesn't sync up with Google Tasks. Not worth the change. Zapier does not work for Android. Zapier only works if you pay the Premium fee plus it only gives the option to add new tasks and complete tasks when integrating with Google Tasks. It does not import current tasks previously created in Google Tasks. There is no way to transfer my 144 tasks from Google to Anydo. And I can't afford $72.00 right off the bat to do it.,Crashes

It used to be my favorite task management app and now I'm searching for alternatives, on the verge of uninstalling it! P.S. Please introduce a feature to permanently sort items by date on the widget itself, when you add a new task. I have to keep going to the main app to sort it by date.",Complaints
"love the idea! but the execution is kind of clumsy. there's little to no guidance with regard to how parties or challenges work, and the rewards seem to be random at best. the graphics are adorable and the app definitely has potential though! but it would be more user friendly to streamline the app because it can be overwhelming with so many choices and options (i.e. mounts, food, eggs, etc) that seem mostly arbitrary.",Praises
Dislike the latest widget downgrade - the loss of the ability to select multiple tasks is frustrating. Not sure how long I will stick with this app now as the widget is far less user friendly than previous version.,Complaints

"Saying free and simple is not telling people it is a 7 day free trial especially at Google play store and people only know it's a 7 day free trial after they download it. So why won't Google do anything about this app developers not mention their apps have a trial period, which results in people downloading apps for nothing. PS 95% of the app is free, until the trial period finishes.",Other
"Love the app, but frequent changes to the UX are frustrating. I manage to get used to changes, develop some muscle memory, and more changes come. The new snoozing experience is very slow! It may be flashy, but it's just painfully slow, it's an added inconvenience. Please at least make it an opt-in feature.",Crashes

"Love this planner. But whenever I use the repeat function, I cant just edit 1 event. I have to edit the rest of the events that are linked together too. Would be great if I'm able to edit jus 1 event even when im using the repeat function. Would also be great if there's a copy and paste of events function! Would make things really easier! 😊",Praises

Dont know what they did but this app doesnt work on my Android 10 device anymore. Lags for ages then just stops working and shuts down. Not helpful. Now my forest wont grow and will become neglected because I am uninstalling this app next and I doubt I'll ever use it again.,Complaints
So close to being the perfect app. 2 things needed before I switch to using it. #1. Add ability to edit and change habit status for previous days. sometimes i don't have time or forget to update my habits on the day of. #2. Ability to set first day of week for calendar (i prefer Monday),Crashes

this is pure magic juat saying best life app out there keep up the great work!!! im ao happy you listen to your customers EDIT: now my entire household is using this app its amazing magic easy to use only thing i noticed is that when you claim a reward if it has an increasing cost sometimes it will spend the gold after the increase instead of before resulting in extra gold loss my best guess is that the script might be changing the cost value before subtracting the gold from the players gold.,Crashes

"TD;DR You have to register. You get blasted with emails. Free version is as good as free native app. It's not clear what features you get if you spend money. It's disappointing. Most features are behind a pay wall (which is fine) - I'd be more than happy to pay if I understood what those features are and having used the app, I still don't know. Also you HAVE to register with them and as soon as you do you get blasted with emails, which is by far the most annoying thing this app does.",Complaints
"The idea is wonderful. But a lot of tedious mistakes spoil the whole impression. For example, information is slowly updated even within the application, often clicking on a menu item is ignored. If you create a task without a title, but with a list, it will become closed for editing, just delete. Not all things are obvious. I had to read help to solve simple questions. Well, the old-school 8-bit graphics - not everyone likes it.",Complaints
I love this app for easily tracking my habits to work towards personal goals. There's only two things that could make this app better: being able to disable decimals on specific habits (to count full numbers would be great as you do sets of a workout and make updating the count easier) and not losing the progress of a goal if you change the specifications to meet it (like going from doing 10 to 20 pushups a day and not losing the streak from before the change was made).,Crashes

"I'm really disappointed with the Wear OS app: * The reminders doesn't works as expected: I hear the notification sound but there is no notification popup, and if I scroll down on the main screen I see ""No notifications"". How am I supposed to know what task I was reminded about? * I can't add a new task with a due date, e.g: ""test 20:10"" because as soon as I type 20 the "":"" button dissapears from the top suggested keys and is not available from the special keys / second keyboard page either (I use the default/google keyboard so that can't be the issue). * The sync is slow, after I added a new todo on the web I had to open the Wear OS app a few times so my new todo also appeared there. Could you maybe add a pull to refresh feature to manully trigger the sync?",Bugs
"Overall a good app. Synchronization is terrible, constantly losing information when using multiple devices. One can make changes on a computer and not see changes on the phone for minutes.

It doesn't always tell you to rate the app and/or share it which is another plus. 11/10, I do recommend!",Praises

"This app has changed the entire course of my life. From health to relationships and productivity. This app is a life saver. One suggestion: regarding habits it would be good if it has all the quotes relating to that habit and so those quotes (maybe along with pictures?) pop up every day on reminder and motivate you. As am example If I want to go to gym, in reminder I am shown random quote written on some inspirational picture.",Crashes
"Custom sound taken away, now you say they're back, thry aren't showing up. Hit and miss with quick add task doing voice input is annoying too.

"I understand the function of the switch. What I meant is that once I had attended to a reminder, I could delete it so that I could remain with a clean slate for future use. Now, combining events and reminders makes it hard to have a clean slate at the beginning of each day cause you can't delete recurring events. I just want reminders tab that's separate from events so that I can always clean my reminders up at the end of each day and know which ones need to be done the next. The app was so elaborate when events and reminders were separate functions.",Praises

Perfect for my needs of tracking goals,Other
Not a fan of the new Foundations update. You promised so many new features and didn't deliver any of them. The update to Subtasks didn't fix some of the core issues with them.,Bugs
Edit: This one complaint has been fixed! Its perfect now I really love this app and I use it everyday! The new black and orange theme is really nice to look at! My only feedback is that I wish the color of the widget changed to match the chosen in-app theme because the yellow list kinda sticks out from my background. Other than that the app is perfect! Thank a lot Levor!!,Crashes
"First of all it's an excellent app. I like the fact that it is highly customizable. However, I'd like to make a suggestion. Your app lacks the ""emotional"" aspect a bit. I suggest to add support of small custom avatar-like images to the tasks instead of monotone colored icons. This way a task will associate with something positive/inspirational. Pressing on a task could then show a larger version of the image in the task view screen. Do not understimate the power of visual associations.",Praises
Great reminders,Praises
"Hey, awesome app. It wasn't long until I purchased the unlocked version. However, some things could be improved. For example, you can't change units after the habit is created. And it would be nice to hide the "".0"" part after digits, since mostly it refers to ""minutes"" or ""iterations"" or ""cups"" and it looks kinda sloppy to see your goal described as ""Learn at least 30.0 minutes"" or ""Drink at least 2.0 cups"". If the number is whole, why not just hide that point zero - it'll look neater, I think.",Crashes
"I love the ability to see my to-do items synced with my Google Cal. That way I can drag my tasks to whenever I want and plan my day out. The only reason I'm giving the app 4 stars is because recurring google calendar events show up multiple times (in the same day) on the calendar view.

Terrible I'm sure I'm not the only one saying this but I'll add mine. It used to be a great app as wunderlist but is now terrible. I can only assume its intentional to force people elsewhere because there's some money to be made. An added recent quirk is it doubling any hylerlink in the notes whenever you close the keyboard ( a more insane quirk i couldn't dream up). Don't bother.,Praises

"I LOOOVE this app! It would give 5 stars, if only it would work😦. It's 
been bad for crashing for months, but I put up with it because I use it so 
much. With the last update thigh, it's even worse. I can't put the widget 
on my phone, it crashes everytime I try, it doesn't give me my reminders 
and crashes half the time I try to use it! Please fix and I'll give 5 
stars!!!",Crashes
The new update brings a lot that was desired. Most importantly list sharing with much better approach than wunderlist. But task assigning within the shared list and chat on a particular task is still missing and this is something that still holds me back from fully migrating from Wunderlist.,Other

I love the layout and different features. Two things that I would love changed or added are: 1.

Love this app. Got the pro version. It will save a lot of my cognitive work!

"Updated review: I have used this app for half a year, against my better judgement.  I have sent eighteen bug reports to the devs.  Little.  I could easily send another twenty more, but it isn't worth the time.  This is simply the most bugged piece of software I have ever used.  The avatars are hideous.  The only good thing that this app has going for it is the clean user interface, and a clever separation of the to-do list into three sections.  It is missing some pretty basic to-do list functionality.  The game loads slowly, and doesn't work without an internet connection.  Some of the bugs I've experienced: Reminders pop up on random days, no matter how many times I readjust their settings. Constantly having trouble connecting to the servers. Visual bugs: shows one item, but you get some other item.  Newly equipped main weapon won't show on avatar until app restarted. Progress bars for quests spaz out every time you open the page. Keyboards won't go away once they pop up. And the list goes on and on...",Bugs

Tasks/Habits which are marked as undone may be send to the bottom, too (-1 *). Whitout Premium you only can scedule up to 7 habits!

Loved this app for years. The new full screen ads with no skip option is ridiculous and will likely drive me away. I understand the need for ads but this is too far and I have no need for any of the pro features so I will not pay for it when I can use a different app for free that doesn't block my productivity.

Edit: This one complaint has been fixed! Its perfect now I really love this app and I use it everyday! The new black and orange theme is really nice to look at!

"""When you view a project, you'll no longer see all the tasks in its sub-projects."" - Mit diesem kurzen Statement wurde ein Kernfeature der App einfach ersatzlos gestrichen und zerstört somit sicherlich nicht nur meinen gesamten Workflow. Auf Nachfrage beim Support bestätigt dieser, dass man noch nicht genau sagen kann, ""wann genau"" ein ähnliches Feature dahingehend kommen wird. ""Generell zukünftig"" hieß es da nur. Da diese Anzeigeweise auch zentraler Part mehrer Projekte war, die ich mit Nicht-Premium-Nutzern teile, stellte ich dem Support des Weiteren die Frage, ob das irgendwann zukünftig geplante Folgefeature auch wieder für Nicht-Premium-Mitglieder verfügbar sein wird. Die Antwort darauf war, dass es egal sei, wenn ich ein Projekt mit einem Nicht-Premium-Kunden teile, da Premiumvorteile immer genutzt werden können, solange man halt eben Premiummitglied ist. Dahingehend also Danke für nichts.  Schade. So gern ich die App auch immer mochte: So kann ich sie nicht mehr benutzen und bei der gezeigten Reaktion des Supports will ich das auch nicht mehr.  ## Edit: ## Die Methode von Doist funktioniert natürlich auch nicht wie gewünscht, nämlich nicht mit Non-Premium-Kunden.

"The app is good and in general highly customizable, but it has one flaw: it uses days (24 hours periods) as a basic unit of measure, but it doesn't let you change the default starting hour (midnight). This is inconvenient for people who have unusual working hours and it makes the app impractical to track daily tasks for users who are more productive at night. I would rate it as a 5 stars app, if I could choose when my day ends and be able to log my dailies properly.",Crashes

Latest update makes the widget not working,Complaints
"Tried it out. The time function, which is 90% of the app IMHO, is clunky. The default ""end"" time is ""until next activity"", but then it automatically changes to the start time of the next activity and you can't change it back. Then, if you add a task that overlaps other start times, it deletes the other activities. I spent 15 minutes setting up a schedule and was frustrated to find that I had erased my entire afternoon schedule because I made a mistake when changing the end time of something mid-day.

"The graphics are adorable, and the UI is clean. There were a few things that were a little confusing to find, but there's a wiki that answers a lot of questions as well as the FAQ. The only reason it doesn't work for me is because tasks feel more like currency than progression. Other task rpg apps either chart your progress or show it as a literal path, which feels more like moving forward. Cute app, but more for those who like armor building in MMOs.",Other

Not too many customization possibilities, the look of the app is a bit bulk and not so elegant. Some reminders are not working. I hope this can help",Complaints
"Ads that completely take over your phone & have a forced timer so you can't exit out of them. - EDIT - It's untrue what the developer says regarding ads appearing once every 18 hours, it is more frequent.

Sure, there are still minor bugs that existed from years ago when I started my first account, but the amount of progress it went through during that time period just shows how much the developers care and how much effort they've put (even just from the display!) in towards realizing this wonderful app for all of us who are looking to better our lives.

"I was excited to use this app and love the categories and reward system for habits, dailies, to-do. After a few days and several rookie mistakes that aren't explained well in the tutorial, I realized this app is way too heavy on the game mechanics for my use. I want to have a list of dailies to partially complete everyday, to encourage reading and writing every now and then, not everyday. This app punishes you for not checking these things off everyday. I totally didn't realize my character was losing tons of health until it hit the red zone. I then started reading up on the death mechanic and am very turned off. I can understand wanting to give the players consequences for missing a task, but it shouldn't be health loss and it should account for how the player uses the dailies (must complete everyday or bonus if completed). They also do not make it easy to provide feedback. All the discussion links either required creating a separate account (different from the habatica account) or were closed threads. This app could be so fun but I feel it loses sight of promoting good habits/organization. I love gaming, but this is super heavy handed mechanics to me. Would keep using this app if I could keep the lists alone.",Praises

The concept is great and it's a fun way to keep track of your habits. My only gripes are: -I wish there was a better way to see habit streaks.

"This app is very, very, very sexist. When you start the app up and go into the ""icon"" menu for the avatar of your ""hero"" character, the vast majority of the icons possibile to select are definitively male.   Worse yet is that all of the ones 'intresting' in thier design - or portray something such as the workplace are entirely male.  The few female icons avalible - more than half not even on their own- are showing an entirely narrow view with a subservient feeling in thier portrayal.   The developers of this app should be ashamed of such blatant misogyny.",Other
"I like this app and I bought Premium, even it was a little expensive (5,49 Euro). What I don't like is: Habits ""with a numeric value"" don't allow ""at least 0 times a day"". If you want to do something 6 times a week, with the possibility to do it twice on one day, it will stay undone the other days (-1 *). Tasks/Habits which are marked as undone may be send to the bottom, too (-1 *). Whitout Premium you only can scedule up to 7 habits! After a removal of any named defect I will change my rating.",Crashes

"This would be great if it didn't require me to mark negatives. in other words, it requires me to mark everyday I did NOT do something, such as smoke a cigarette or drink alcohol. This is overly cumbersome over time and is going to cause me to stop using the app because I don't want to have to check everything that DIDN'T happen.

"I bought the pro version and like it so far. For now what I'm really missing is the ability to change days from the widget itself, with the left and right arrows, and not only from inside the app. Why wouldn't you enable the left and right arrows to change day as default? Having to go into the app to review past or coming days defeats the purpose of the widget, and forces you to use something else other than the widget itself. Other than that, the app seems to be very practical. If the ability to swipe from one day to the next day or to the last day from the widget gets implemented, it would be a 5 star app for me.

A very good to do manager. I would take a premium version if on the Windows version it would possible to set/change/manage location reminders. For this feature I already wait some years.

But it seems to be to difficult for the programmers...??? So when this is to difficult what can we expect? Will the maintanance of the Windows app stay on a reliable basis???

Edit: in response to the creator's response to my comment, it IS important to keep in mind that this is a free app, with no possibility to upgrade, meaning this is not a professionally-developed app, so there should be no guarantee or expectation of quality.

So if I wanted my reminder to tell me what time the meeting was, I can't see it anymore. Too bad this option can't be turned off.",Complaints

I do understand the need for ads, and that a lot of work is put into the app, and I appreciate all your hard work on it ;)",Complaints
Ads interrupt you while adding items to your calendar. This app used to have a banner for ads at the bottom which was fine. Now the ads are annoying and timed. Reply to developer: No thanks. I rather uninstall your app completely. 👌,Complaints

"One of the key premium features of this app is labeling, which unfortunately doesn't work properly. When I try to move a label to a shared section, the app crashes. Additionally there is an inconsistency between Android and iOS in how the labels work. In Android I can see the whole list of labels even without tasks, on iOS a label is deleted when there are no tasks marked with the label.

"Overall not a bad app. For the first week or so, it gave me notifications when it was supposed to, but after that, it's almost like it forgot sometimes itself, e.g. notification on Saturday when I set it for Friday. Reminders for things I have set daily don't even come up anymore, but it remembers to give me an display-over-app notification to remind me to set a reminder. Also, no push notifications that take you into the app so you'd have to do it yourself. Sub-tasks are my favourite feature!",Complaints
"Overall decent functionality but clunky execution. The premium version has good calendar functions but the notifications are spotty and don't work well with my phone, which defeats the purpose for me. The sub task feature is nice but organizing them is difficult.",Praises
"I like this app for the most part. Loads of different plugins however if you want to change the date for your reminder from the default date, it takes 7 taps! SEVEN! That is not great UX and needs to improve. I miss the Wunderlist style smart date adding. Update: The new smart date feature makes this a 5 star app for me!",Crashes
amazing ! thank you,Praises
It seems the app is not build for longer and more complex use. It looks like it can be used for people that plan to follow and develop their behaviour but the level of this app is of a game. Takes too long for resolving the bugs and no reaction to feedback. App crashes when using the calendar options. This should not happend when using payed version of the app. Waiting for improvement or giving up using and paying for this app.,Bugs

Same issue as Don Smith who wrote a review on 10/10/19. Will consider this app but the lack of slide visuals and character visuals makes the app in-op.

I wasn't able to login to my account actually I'm a pro customer it's a bad experience.,Complaints
"I like the simplicity of this app, very easy to use casually. I especially like it doesn't require an online account like all the other data vacuums. I would like to see cloud storage integration, Dropbox, Drive, etc. Another thing that i would love which I hope others would agree is having a defer action on tasks/habits to defer the item to next day. I can edit the task and set the date as next day,but it would be a nice feature. Would pay extra on top of premium for these. Good work 👍",Praises
Great planner! Very easy to use. I have had no problems with this app.,Bugs
"I love this app, but have one major disappointment - when I input something in the calendar that lasts more than one day, it doesn't show a solid bar of colour from day 1-last day. Usually at least the first or last day (or both) show up as a separate event. It is very annoying and confusing.",Praises
Update: June 2020: do not use this app free version. It recently started forcing full screen ads that lock your screen for the duration of the ad. Original review from 2018: Great app!

So I ended up having to completely delete that todoist account and make a new one with a different email. That was some time ago (two years?) So it's possible the sync function is improved.",Praises
"App was useful, but I was very disappointed when a large number of trees were moved to premium without warning. I had been saving up and watching extra ads for coins for weeks, and then found there was nothing I wanted to spend those coins on. It felt underhanded - I thought the deal was that I watch ads, app gets revenue, and I get a nice tree, but then that deal changed.

the new update locked several of the trees behind a paywall. this is disgraceful because all users should be able to unlock them by using the app. there is no justification for taking away important parts of the app that were previously available to everyone and now only premium users can access them. the devs must change this back so that all previously released trees can be unlocked by anyone. edit: there are many other reviews with the same problem but the devs don't care.

"I used to like this app. Been using it for a few years with tolerably okay results. But it's been having too many problems with sync, and with failing to load ""Karma"" data. Not only that, but if you miss checking a box but don't see that omission until the next day, there's nothing you can do about it. Maybe the fatal flaw of this app is that it has too many features for its own good. I'd like to get rid of sync entirely and just use the app on my Android, but apparently that can't be done, and if I delete my online account I delete everything. I think I just want to dump this flawed app and see if I can find a good app that does everything offline in one device with no registration required.",Bugs

If something doesn't work 100%, remove it. Very disappointed. VERY! Edit: I didn't get any warning, nothing. If the other option is the recommended one (which I hate that it adds an alarm icon in the status bar. other apps work without doing this), it doesn't mean the other one IS NOT WORKING. Bad.

Here's how this is very bad for me:  - I have many recurring daily tasks, and it's a very tedious job to mark all my recurring tasks as done, even those that were NOT done! It gets much worse if I don't use the app for a few days! Then I have to mark all recurring tasks as done for every and each previous day!!!!  - The app forces me to record false information! A task that was not done on a specific day, should stay there as NOT done, and the recurring task should be generated for the following day.  - You have only 3 options for a recurring task: 1) to mark it as done in order for it to appear on the following day. 2) not to mark it as done, and it will never ""recur""! 3) to delete, and it disappears, and naturally, it will never ""recur""!

Also, no push notifications that take you into the app so you'd have to do it yourself. Sub-tasks are my favourite feature!",Complaints

Mind you, i'd never talk to anyone like that in a public group. i don't mind policing the language of users if they are abusive or using foul language like that in public, but to me its a bit much to ban people for a private conversation, where there was no victims, but its not within my power to change the community guidelines. hopefully i'll get unbanned so i can give the app a swing. it does seem great. only 3 stars for being so quick to jump the ban hammer. will definetly change stars for the better, if the community guidelines loosen up in regards to private conversations and partys. maybe add a report button instead?",Crashes

"It's ok but I wish I could move activities around in a routine instead of having to manually change the time one by one E.g. if I have yoga 9-10 then study 10-12 and want to swap them I can't just move around the blocks I have to delete study, change the time of yoga then add study with the new time.

No backup feature. Use Titanium Backup. Share option ok but only one list, need full backup export all. 4. Need 100% offline.",Crashes

I ended up having to make a new calendar and syncing only that one. I was able to change the colors of each event in the app. Very easy to use overall.",Crashes

"I regret buying this app. (TL;DR: don't use this app if you ever intend on changing routines or planning.) Changing existing routines is very hard as it simply deletes whatever overlaps in time. So unnecessary and impossible to revert. If you accidentally click PM instead of AM once, your whole day is deleted permanently. Also, every time I want to sync between my phone and my tablet I have to export it to Google Drive and then import it from the other device. Also, you can't copy items or days to another time.

Also, would love to be able to highlight a day in the future as a milestone, just different colour so I can say 50, 100 days etc, as a motivator. It's great for a free app. We'll done to the devs on this.",Crashes
"I downloaded and paid for this app several days ago. It has some good aspects. But now I literally HATE some other aspects of it! For example, if you set a specific time for a specific time (e.g. 1-3 pm), it DISAPEARS without giving you a chance to do anything with it. So, if you didn't finish that task, you are out of luck if you want to move it to somewhere else! How ridiculous it is! I'm really scared. I can't trust this tool. I have to switch to something else and cut my losses.",Complaints

I have to remove the widget from my home screen, then re-add it & switch list to Important - every day! Today was the 5th day of doing this, and I got fed up, so switched to Google Tasks, which is now a much better app than it used to be, & better than To Do.",Praises
A very productive app. The only bad thing was that the dark theme was not available for free. Rest everything was fine.,Complaints
"This app was quite useful to have and something I think that I needed. The only thing that put me off was the 'premium '. It slightly ruins it so I would definitely make everything accessible to everyone if I would change something about this app. Other than that, quite handy little app that will probably make a difference to your day!",Crashes
A lot worse UX than wunderlist,Other
The fact there are no predefined tasks makes it super hard to use. Or rather this will work if user can just define the task (quest) easily. Or maybe we can import (by purchasing) some set of quests. For me it is still quite confusing and hard to manage with all the options offered. would be use it furthere more if not too complicated,Other
"I just installed the app and ran it to see how I liked it. For my taste, way too crowded UI. Then, I started receiving email notifications at least once a day about a task it automatically creates for the user, which is to add a task. I was annoyed so I uninstalled it. The email notifications continued. I had to manually unsubscribe from receiving email notifications about a task I never created from an app I am not using. Unjustifiable behavior!",Complaints

"It really helps with getting things done! Receiving XP, gold and different skills makes uninteresting tasks much easier to do. I like that - on the contrary to other apps - it is actually useful without having to get the premium version. Though the premium version is a nice addition. Suggestion: some rewards could already be existent so you don't have to come up with them yourself. I personally don't have many ideas for coming up with rewards and don't know what gold price would be appropriate.",Other

Most of my habits are to be done a certain number of times per week so it would be great to have a week view where you can see the ticks and crosses for each habit so far that week, for all habits at the same time (I know you can see them one at a time by clicking ""last 7 days"" but clicking on this for one habit closes this view for another).

"Every update have been a step backwards. All the small changes only made everything less convenient and looks like will only continue to do so. The last straw for me is now you can't add things quickly (to default ""inbox"" project) anymore, now you have to spend several more clicks to designate a project, even though I just want to add quickly to the default inbox. Making the quick add widget useless now. Also premium pricing has always been terrible and greedy (monthly cost instead of one time).",Crashes

The default ""end"" time is ""until next activity"", but then it automatically changes to the start time of the next activity and you can't change it back. Then, if you add a task that overlaps other start times, it deletes the other activities. I spent 15 minutes setting up a schedule and was frustrated to find that I had erased my entire afternoon schedule because I made a mistake when changing the end time of something mid-day. This app was, for me, ironically, a waste of time.",Crashes

"I wanted to use this app. The concept is really good. But I won't use it simply because it barely functions. For starters it's online only... but as if that wasn't enough the sync on Android is just all over the place - the app would sometimes ask ""have you done these things today?"" for tasks that were scheduled the day before or at 1 AM for tasks on that day... Speaking of tasks, I couldn't set up multiple repeating tasks for certain days of the week (per task, wanted to fill the whole week with various tasks and repeat them) for some reason, they would all sync to same weekdays. I enabled reminders but never had a reminder come up once and as far as I researched online this is a common problem on Android and hasn't been resolved for some time.

What is the point then? Ridicilous. Put ads in it if anything, but not lock the very few items you have available behind a currency that costs real money.",Other
"The idea is wonderful, truly. But problems exist:
1) Bugs: to-do list, and dailies keep being empty. Refreshing doesn't work, only close and reopen app.
2) Monthly subscription seems highly excessive - I don't like paying for a service that remains static. This could, and should IMO, be an offline app. Particularly with the existing obvious bugs, payment is out of the question right now.

The only thing I'm sad about is that the new trees that have been added recently don't change over time. Whether you plant it for half an hour or two hours, it'll end up looking the same. And that sucks cuz letting my tree be more beautiful if I plant one for longer is a motivation factor for me. So I'd like to see that change :)",Crashes
Edit: This one complaint has been fixed! Its perfect now I really love this app and I use it everyday! The new black and orange theme is really nice to look at!

Fantastic app but 4 stars. Every part has been a comfortable experience for me until I started trying to use it across devices. I took me around 30 minutes to set up all my tasks the first time and when I signed into my account for the app all the tasks I had made got overwritten by the default tasks from the other device. It was partially my fault for the careless order that I signed in on the devices. But perhaps my issue could have been avoided entirely if when it attempted to sync my tasks from the internet the first time it asked me if I wanted to use the database that is from the internet or that is local. Would have saved me a lot of headache remaking all the tasks again. That said every other function provided is great and I would recommend.,Bugs

I settled an alarm on this app. But it never popped up. This looks like a great app but please fix this. All my notifications in this app is open.,Praises
Truly the best planning app! I was looking for a planning app with widgets that can change their size. Was harder than I thought! I love that you can see everythubg even in the smallest widget. That was very important to me. What I also like is that you can see all your tasks in a time line sorted by time. This way I don't miss anything. Subtasks and notes are helpful. I like the separate feature for the shopping list! This app is super flexible and intuitive!,Crashes

I'm struggling with this app. I'm trying so hard to like it but there are basic things that I want it to do that it doesn't seem to be able to do. 1: It doesn't seem to be able to set a reminder for a whole list to alert me during any particular day. Instead I seem to have to set an alarm for each task which means that I would have alarms going off all day. That would drive me insane! 2: It isn't possible to contact the developer through the app. Quite bizarre!,Other

"Hey, awesome app. It wasn't long until I purchased the unlocked version. However, some things could be improved. For example, you can't change units after the habit is created. And it would be nice to hide the "".0"" part after digits, since mostly it refers to ""minutes"" or ""iterations"" or ""cups"" and it looks kinda sloppy to see your goal described as ""Learn at least 30.0 minutes"" or ""Drink at least 2.0 cups"".

You then have to click through two more screens to tap it again just to add a reminder and set the time. To make all that official there's a tiny check at the top of the screen to tap. Then, nothing really. No confirmation or summary, nothing. You have to double check that you got it right. Also, updates do nothing. Laborious.",Other

"Great app in the beginning. But once you start skipping days, the notifications become insulting shaming words. For example, calling me a couch potato. Which I am not. So dumb.

[Edit follows, to respond to Todoist's reply:] Thanks for replying. Yes, as you say, ""sorting in filtered views is not possible"". Or to use non-developer language, ""Ugghhh, why can't I sort this list by project or in another way that suits me?""

"it was good until the recent updates. i installed this app because of its widget. however, the recent update destroyed everything that i have customised. there are a lot of setting to make the widget looks good but the update limited the setttings. i event went all out in purchasing the app thinking it could be like it used to be, maybe i can change it back with unlimited setting, but it's not as good as before. im disappointed",Crashes

"Really useful, it helps me organize and keep track of my daily tasks. I use To Do on both windows and android. My only problem is when it sync the changes on desktop , the widget on my phone doesn't change at all until I open the app. A refresh button on the widget would do, or make it sync like google keep.",Bugs
"Thieves! I paid for the pro version on another Google account, but I had to delete that account because of a massive influx of spam and harassment. Every other developer understood my situation and was kind enough to provide me with a promotion code so that I could have full access to the software of theirs I paid for. Not these jerks! I spread the blame equally on Google for failing to provide a way to transfer purchases, and on these developers for being predatory capitalist pigs.",Other
Very useful. Clearly laid out. Update in 2020:. Excellent app.,Praises
"It's a cool app, but I wished there was a way to know how much you have improved week by week or a similar record. It doesn't really push you to improve, just to do something, if you do less than before, it's ok, you just advance slower and you keep going slow. It would motivate me more to try and do better than the last day or the last week, but I wouldn't know how that was unless I took a screenshot :/",Complaints
It keeps lagging and dificult to select the traits i want for my character... ugh ! Not worth it UNINSTALL !,Complaints
"The most fully-featured task tracking app I've seen. A little daunting at first, I recommend ignoring a lot of the xp sliders and special options until you are used to the general mechanics. Once you realize you can ignore or tweak any mechanics you dislike, it's value shines through. There's enough options in the mechanics that you can use what systems you like and ignore the rest.",Complaints

Ads interrupt you while adding items to your calendar. This app used to have a banner for ads at the bottom which was fine. Now the ads are annoying and timed. Reply to developer: No thanks. I rather uninstall your app completely. 👌,Complaints

"The game is very buggy, I just bought a reward, then the app crashed, and the gold I've spent is gone, but I didn't receive the reward. These kind of experiences unfortunately decrease the gaming fun tremendously, and it could be such a good game otherwise!",Bugs
"I really like the depth of this tracker, including skills, titles, really more of an Elder Scrolls feel, and personally, seeing myself being lacking in certain skills would motivate me to add more tasks that would improve those. I was all set to subscribe and spend too many hours customizing the experience curve, all of the tasks and their various skills, and really dig into the advanced features, but then I hit the deal breaker. There is no web interface for this app. Everything has to be set up on your phone. I love having notifications and a checklist on my phone to keep up with repeating tasks, habits, and to-dos on the go, but I'm looking for an app to add dozens of things to initially, and continue adding and modifying as time goes on, but to have to do that on my Note 20+ is just something I'm not on board with. I need to be able to pull it up on my computer as I'm working to check things off, or see my next scheduled task. By picking up my phone being the only way to check what I need to do, it sets me up for failure, because my phone is a distraction I'm trying to use less while working. And since I'm working from home now, there's no accountability, so that temptation to check my facebook notifications is strong. If there was a way to open this on a browser (and not through some janky android emulator, or using my chromebook, because I don't use that for work) then I'd already be neck deep in it, but sadly I'm stuck using an app that replaces the reward of tracking real life stat progression with digital outfits for your avatar, something I couldn't care less about. Please get a browser interface going!!",Praises

This app is awesome. I love that you can have lists and sublists. And how you can set alarms.,Praises
There are certain things I love like the fact that it sorts my grocery list by aisle automatically. But overall this app stresses me out. I just want an app that allows me to share my grocery list. But the grocery list seems buried in an area that isn't intuitive. I don't need something to schedule every second of my life which seems to be more this apps aim.,Praises
"Cant even get past the first screen. I get a notice that my phone is blocking the app, but there are no instructions in the troubleshooting for my pixel, I've looked all over my settings, there's nothing I can find to change to ""allow"" this app to do something. Frankly I'm dubious that this app somehow needs some extreme level of permissions that no other ever has, especially as it hasnt told me why.",Crashes

The issue seems to be a couple of years old (you can check it in the customer section on their website), and nothing was done to address it, while the competition syncs in seconds. If you don't need Google sync, then it's great. I'm now using another app. Sad.",Bugs
"Loved TickTick - great interface and the widget was perfect. Unfortunately I had to move on to Todoist. TickTick doesn't have Alexa capabilities and that's a deal breaker. For a while, IFTTT and Gmail provided a good workaround, but recent changes to Gmail rendered that functionality inoperable. TickTick, get on board with Alexa and I'll come back.",Crashes
"The UX is horribly clunky and it takes more than two clicks just to do anything. Coming from Todoist to this is like a bird flying into tar pit! All the habit and time management improving features are sort of stuck behind the horrible UI. Why do I need to see soooo many boxes and options when I just want to and a single to-do. Further more, why does it take 2 taps just to get to that screen in the first place?! If I'm on the Todo tab, I probably want to add a to-do. I honestly haven't seen an app this bad in years.",Complaints
"Great Concept but executed poorly. I added 2 events between 6.30am and 9.30 but when I tried adding one for 10.30am it would let me, saying it overlapped with another event which it did not. I even checked my calendar and nothing was there for that time. It's now 11.42am, I tried adding an event for 3.30pm and it said its saved but hasn't showed on the clock or anything so it's pretty useless at this point.",Praises
It's great for catching up with assignments! ^^,Praises
I have had some problems over time with losing calendar items and duplication of events. I ended up having to switch to outlook.,Bugs
"Way to easy to lose your task as they disapear when checked. Example, I got distracted for 10 seconds with my phone in my hand and ToDoIst app open and when I looked back at my phone 4 task had disappeared and I'm left trying to remember wish task it was! Really bad for an app that suppose to help you organize. I'm uninstalling because of this.",Complaints

"Easiest way for me to use Habitica. Simple but motivating. I'm not sure if moving the plus button to the center was a good idea, it covers more of the text of the tasks there.

It's a really great app and I love it! but for some reason since last week it's not opening and working well..... It shows troubleshooting problems but when I check nothing is there. Also I have given all permissions but still I have to refresh every 3-4 hours to get notifications. Please check it!! Otherwise it's great!!!!,Bugs

"This app is great! I love the idea of turning my daily life like an RPG game. But I have this goal to wash my face twice everyday and it feels repetitive to make two task for the exact same thing. So can you guys make a task where it has to be done twice before the said task is completed? Been trying my hardest to do this on your app, even finished reading the user guide, but it still wouldn't work.",Praises

Great app for all my To Do lists. There are just minor issues in syncing sometimes,Bugs

Bad app,Complaints
"It was already very irritating to see your latest added tasks being pushed at the bottom and you have to everytime open the app to rearrange.

Probably gonna uninstall the app if this is not fixed soon.",Complaints
Buggy but awesome!,Bugs
Doesn't save my timeline ....have to redo my while schedule now,Other
"I absolutely love this app. I am using for a couple weeks and it is really helping me with my tasks. I tried similar apps and they're not quite as good. Tasks are highly customisable and gives tons of options. So why not 5 stars? Well, there are some issues, but please take them as constructive criticism. 1. It is not respecting the silence mode. 2. Steep learning curve. (Worth it though) 3. Auto failing task with subtask is not working. I will promptly give 5 starts when #1 is fixed!!!",Bugs

"Fundamental problem in their development cycle...force users to update, but the value to the consumer doesn't have a feedback mechanism prior to forcing the update. Is there not a beta program with participating users? Todoist, that's what you need to fix.

You can alot time at irregular basis eg a task can be for 20 mins whereas the other could be for 90 mins. The notification are at par and do good job at reminding us our next task. The information that one needs to fill in when adding a task, is accurate and is easy.

Hate it,Complaints
"Love the app. Best of it's kind IMO. Not perfect but so close! This app has the potential to be used for so much more than just habits and tasks! If I may suggest: - having the "".00"" digits be optional and not by default when setting/entering goals. - having multiple reminder/notification throughout the day on one habit to enter data multiple times a day (ex: 200 push ups a day, with 4 reminders so I can do 4x50 or something instead of having 4 habits) or the ability to group habits.",Praises

I had a hard time figuring out the differences between the different areas to set up things you want to improve on. The terminology isn't understandable (no clue as to what separates Habits from Dailies from Tasks), and unfortunately, because I still couldn't understand what I was supposed to do and where, it's not very usable for me. The bug that left me in tutorial/hanging hell was enough.

Fantastic idea!!! I've actively been seeking something just like this for a long time. But the app itself is super glitchy. Most things wont load and everything keeps resetting. It might be my connection or my phone. I'm not sure. Hoping I can figure it out cause I love this!,Bugs
"So far, great.",Praises
"Guys you created a great app that I'd been using for years, but the latest update is weird. Modal views when selecting a single task (WHY do I need it instead of previous submenu for rescheduling??), no ability to choose multiple tasks (only by top menu - select tasks), strange icons.. That all makes me really sad. Rolled out to the previous friendly Todoist :(",Praises

not too bad,Complaints
"Liked the prioritization by dragging and the highlighting, but there does not seem to be a way to create recurring tasks. That's a deal -breaker for me. I'm uninstalling",Complaints
"In a word: clunky. I like the calendar integration, however everything else is basic and clunky. Simply adding a task to a list takes 3 clicks and you CANNOT SET A DATE, TIME, SUBTASKS, OR NOTES UNLESS YOU EXIT OUT OF THE TASK AND GOING BACK TO YOUR LIST. The app is designed to give you as many notifications as it can and constantly advertise the premium version. And whatever you do, DO NOT SIGN UP FOR A FREE TRIAL UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING TO SPEND AN HOUR SEARCHING FOR HOW TO DO SO.",Complaints

I absolutely love how it looks after the latest update - super clean and fresh. 5 stars and many thanks to the hardworking devs. Love habitica. I find the app often has one bug or another from update to update, so can't really give 5 stars, but the devs do a smashing job regardless so 4 stars from me.",Bugs
"Habitica is the best productivity app I've used thus far. It lasted me for months. The quests are the most motivating feature, and I was able to take down a couple bosses solo. However, motivation dried up weeks into my first fetch quest because despite being extremely productive, I had no chance of finding even one shard. Unless you're comfortable teaming up with a bunch of strangers to take on quests, there becomes a point when being solo makes the quest motivation feature impossible.",Other
"Lowered the score after seeing no highly needed feature updates after 8 months. Had to switch from Wunderlist. To Do -still- lacks functions which make Wunderlist so great. Importing worked well, but sharing previously shared lists required me to make a new 'personal' account - this wasn't an issue before. All is set up now and the app -still- feels limited still. Most of all, why switch? Why not just rename Wunderlist to say 'Microsoft Wunderlist?",Bugs
"Make it easier to understand when you're activating quests. I didn't have anyone in my party by I was still somehow doing it and finished it by myself without realizing it. Make a design change/renaming so that there's something labeled ""start quest"". Still a fun and useful app. Growth is neverending",Crashes

It is great....,Praises
The splash screen says the account is free forever. But to have reminder of events / tasks a fairly fundemental aspect to a task reminder app its £3 per month. That's quite misleading. #response to the developer. Thank you for responding. The main point is that a reminder function is a key aspect of a to do list rather than a premium feature.... best wishes with the app.,Praises
Was good for years until it suddenly stopped working & all my tasks gone. Update didn't fix it. Uninstall....,Complaints
"I upgraded to Pro after a couple of weeks & initially excited about the app. Having used it for a while now I'm starting to regret my purchase. There are some pros but more cons. It's buggy, doesn't sync well at all across devices, the UI is very cluttered, the forum needs serious updating, a search tool for eg. The last update was ages ago, given how pricey this is you'd think the developers would make it worth it but they seem to have disappeared!",Bugs

I'm changing my rating from 5 to 2. I've used this app for many years and I love it. It's a great app!

Used this app for years but the recent addition of full screen ads is too annoying. Small banner ads or something similar would be much more appropriate for a calendar app. Why would I want to look at an ad for half a minute when it should only take 5 seconds to add an appointment?,Complaints
App keeps on crashing while starting,Crashes
"Overall a good app. Synchronization is terrible, constantly losing information when using multiple devices. One can make changes on a computer and not see changes on the phone for minutes. If you close the computer app immediately you may never see those changes. Really it's 2 star, but the app is great compared to other trash on the market.",Crashes
"This is a great app, highly recommended. Im not sure if it has a monthly routine option pls do tell about it. Also I would like to know if the data saved can be linked to a user account, so if I change device I can continue using my routine/schedule without adding all over again. Thanks.",Crashes

Why widget is not working....???!!!!!,Complaints
"Very nice app with a bad drawback: today's repetition for a recurring task will not appear unless I mark yesterday's task as done! Here's how this is very bad for me:  - I have many recurring daily tasks, and it's a very tedious job to mark all my recurring tasks as done, even those that were NOT done! It gets much worse if I don't use the app for a few days! Then I have to mark all recurring tasks as done for every and each previous day!!!!  - The app forces me to record false information! A task that was not done on a specific day, should stay there as NOT done, and the recurring task should be generated for the following day.  - You have only 3 options for a recurring task: 1) to mark it as done in order for it to appear on the following day. 2) not to mark it as done, and it will never ""recur""! 3) to delete, and it disappears, and naturally, it will never ""recur""!  A recurring task should recur, regardless of marking or not marking the previous repetition as done!",Complaints

"Love the app. Best of it's kind IMO. Not perfect but so close! This app has the potential to be used for so much more than just habits and tasks! If I may suggest: - having the "".00"" digits be optional and not by default when setting/entering goals. - having multiple reminder/notification throughout the day on one habit to enter data multiple times a day (ex: 200 push ups a day, with 4 reminders so I can do 4x50 or something instead of having 4 habits) or the ability to group habits.",Praises

"I'm so disappointed here. I've read other reviews talk about the site being much better, but here is the reality of that. A majority of internet users don't use full browsers to surf it. So this app had to be good, because your habits are a private and important thing. And it's absolutely not good. The last (but not only) straw was when parts of a menu are rendering in completely the wrong place, and won't clear. Inviting people to your party was way too confusing, until I found out it didn't even work until I did it manually *on the site*. There's more, but I won't bother. I know its supposed to be open source but is ANY testing happening? I was trying to be an advocate for this and you guys just killed it for me with this bad app.",Complaints

"I bought the pro version and like it so far. For now what I'm really missing is the ability to change days from the widget itself, with the left and right arrows, and not only from inside the app. Why wouldn't you enable the left and right arrows to change day as default? Having to go into the app to review past or coming days defeats the purpose of the widget, and forces you to use something else other than the widget itself. Other than that, the app seems to be very practical. If the ability to swipe from one day to the next day or to the last day from the widget gets implemented, it would be a 5 star app for me. Thanks.",Crashes

A great app. I just downloaded it and I already love it. The only issue here is slight ui bugs.

"I seriously don't understand. The basic functions of the app are so janky and broken. In the avatar creation, I had to keep pressing the options I wanted over and over for it to actually work, then when I finished the avatar had options I didn't pick. Every habit defaults to being both positive and negative. I know there has to be some default, but it's kind of weird that if I have a positive habit I have to tap the negative button. Adding tags is really clunky because the tags have to be added to the filter, (I guess it works but it's unintuitive to have to add a tag to the filter instead of just tagging the task itself) but when I add them they don't immediately get added. They disappear and then get added a few minutes later. Half the time it won't let me move around the tasks. Sometimes the FAQ text pops up overlaying whatever screen I'm on. Switching between habits, dailies, to-dos, and rewards is finicky. Sometimes swiping doesn't work, sometimes trading the icon doesn't work. I have to tap things in the equipment menu multiple times for them to work. Same for the avatar menu. With patience all this stuff does eventually work, but it's tedious to just use the app. The app would be 10 times better just by fixing the buggy menus",Bugs
"Overall a good app. Synchronization is terrible, constantly losing information when using multiple devices. One can make changes on a computer and not see changes on the phone for minutes.

I suspected a system glitch and contacted the developer on June 17th of this year. I haven't received any response yet. I found my way around this problem by this time. I will not renew my subscription anymore. I will look for another app developer with a better customer service.,Bugs

"The BEST app for motivation and tracking! Even putting the game aspect aside, I have never seen a more user-friendly app for habit/task tracking. I love how there are different categories for habits, tasks, and daily to-dos. It's customizable. Getting coins is motivation! Ive recommended it to everyone!

Tasks are highly customisable and gives tons of options. So why not 5 stars? Well, there are some issues, but please take them as constructive criticism. 1. It is not respecting the silence mode. 2. Steep learning curve. (Worth it though) 3. Auto failing task with subtask is not working. I will promptly give 5 starts when #1 is fixed!!!",Bugs

Not happening but the app still works well and does as stated above.",Praises

The concept is great and it's a fun way to keep track of your habits. My only gripes are: -I wish there was a better way to see habit streaks. The number is cool but if we could see it on a calendar like view I think that would be helpful.

The different labels (programmer, etc.) don't make much sense in the context of the app. You can't check an item as 'done', and if something in your day changes and you need to adjust or reorder your routine for one day, you can't, which makes the app a bit useless.",Crashes

"I seriously don't understand. The basic functions of the app are so janky and broken. In the avatar creation, I had to keep pressing the options I wanted over and over for it to actually work, then when I finished the avatar had options I didn't pick. Every habit defaults to being both positive and negative. I know there has to be some default, but it's kind of weird that if I have a positive habit I have to tap the negative button. Adding tags is really clunky because the tags have to be added to the filter, (I guess it works but it's unintuitive to have to add a tag to the filter instead of just tagging the task itself) but when I add them they don't immediately get added. They disappear and then get added a few minutes later. Half the time it won't let me move around the tasks. Sometimes the FAQ text pops up overlaying whatever screen I'm on. Switching between habits, dailies, to-dos, and rewards is finicky. Sometimes swiping doesn't work, sometimes trading the icon doesn't work. I have to tap things in the equipment menu multiple times for them to work. Same for the avatar menu. With patience all this stuff does eventually work, but it's tedious to just use the app. The app would be 10 times better just by fixing the buggy menus",Bugs
So far so good. I love creating my own adventure. Still learning some of the functions. Maybe a tips video could help. I can't wait to see what other fun things can be added.

"Very good app. Helps me keep organized, and does not let me forget anything. Also, syncs with the google account so I don't miss any dates. I would only suggest that they change all the tasks paid options to the free app, so we could have the opportunity to compartimentalize the complex tasks in projects and also to repeat the tasks daily or weekly, to achieve milestones and to track them.

"I am completely in love with this app. This app has changed my life completely. Which is why I want it to get even better. Here is a small recommendation. Make a 4 week calender system (A/B/C/D week) so that if you want to make a schedule where you take 1 day off after 3 days of work, It is completely possible to make a routine that will keep repeating itself. (4dayx7=4x7day) by simple math, once you get to 5th week, you are back to the same pattern as that of 1st week and so, the cycle goes on",Crashes
Ugly all white ui themes make almost no difference. No option to keep completed tasks in list. Sync is unreliable and does not even notify the user when unsuccessful.

today. I wanted to change that my 6-8pm block of time just today, but can 
only do so by deleting the event for EVERY Monday to Thursday to clear my 
timeline. Makes no sense to clear that block of time and need to re-create 
that exercise block for all the other Monday to Fridays. If something 
unexpected happens at 6pm next Friday, I'll have to delete it ALLL, and 
recreate all over again after just to clear my timeline. If you get this

"Love this app, but it & my exchange outlook calendar stop syncing, even manually, every few days (not email, just calendar). Any ideas why?",Crashes
"To be fair, I downloaded it and uninstalled it after a couple of minutes. The reason for this is that I hate apps that scream ""pay me money"" since the instance you download it, and this one did that exactly. With the ""free premium trial"" being in your face all the time, and then setting it up or going through the tutorial you could see all the features and all you could see is ""premium"". Just do the app as a paid one instead of begging for people to pay for it. It looks amazing though.",Praises
"Sharing does not work in ANY way. For basic ToDo its OK, Sharing its Absolute TRASH.

And what is even worse is if the sharing destination user updates any tasks that task disappear from The To Do List. that means items disappear",Crashes

However, I purchased the Premium version and have been unable to restore said purchase after resetting my phone. The app is good but this is frustrating.

Not really functional,Praises
"The best to-do app I have used for quite some time. It's intuitive, has lots of functionality and is as simple or as complex as you need it to be. You do need to opt for the Premium subscription to get the most out of it but the free version is still one of the best out there.",Praises
"I love this program could be 5 stars BUT... a task adds Tick Tick to the shared text in the paid version. This not good and means you have to remove it every time!

"Love the app, it's much fun, engaging, and helpful to stay focused on your goals and developing new habits. Much better than competing apps (Habitica comes to mind) even if they have better social integration.

"""When you view a project, you'll no longer see all the tasks in its sub-projects."" - Mit diesem kurzen Statement wurde ein Kernfeature der App einfach ersatzlos gestrichen und zerstört somit sicherlich nicht nur meinen gesamten Workflow. Auf Nachfrage beim Support bestätigt dieser, dass man noch nicht genau sagen kann, ""wann genau"" ein ähnliches Feature dahingehend kommen wird. ""Generell zukünftig"" hieß es da nur. Da diese Anzeigeweise auch zentraler Part mehrer Projekte war, die ich mit Nicht-Premium-Nutzern teile, stellte ich dem Support des Weiteren die Frage, ob das irgendwann zukünftig geplante Folgefeature auch wieder für Nicht-Premium-Mitglieder verfügbar sein wird. Die Antwort darauf war, dass es egal sei, wenn ich ein Projekt mit einem Nicht-Premium-Kunden teile, da Premiumvorteile immer genutzt werden können, solange man halt eben Premiummitglied ist. Dahingehend also Danke für nichts.  Schade. So gern ich die App auch immer mochte: So kann ich sie nicht mehr benutzen und bei der gezeigten Reaktion des Supports will ich das auch nicht mehr.  ## Edit: ## Die Methode von Doist funktioniert natürlich auch nicht wie gewünscht, nämlich nicht mit Non-Premium-Kunden.

"This is the app I've been looking for but there's still room for improvement. First off, when setting the default notification to x amount of minutes before, it would make most sense to also have a notification the moment it actually happens, or at least have the option to do so without having to do it manually for every single entry. Second there is a lack of flexibility. There should be a way to easily move around and resize items on your schedule without changing the routines themselves.",Crashes
"Well I saw a lot of people using this app, and base on they're ratings they say it's good but for me It's not, the app constantly crashes if I click some buttons inside the apps, It always crashes whenever I try or need to use it, Please fix it I really want to use this :<",Crashes
Uninstalled it as soon as it started sending me Ad notifications. Why does any developer think this is acceptable? Disgusting.,Complaints

I wouldn't use most of the stickers, which is unfortunate because I love my stickers in my planners. Overall....good start?",Bugs

Overall, a great experience. The app itself is nice as a To-Do list or to organize your numerous tasks by due date, categories as well as location.",Bugs
"Good idea for an app, but I uninstalled due to overcomplicated interface. For example, there are 2 ""+"" symbols, neither of which are self-explanatory (is it for a sub list of main list or another sub list category. I'd prefer there to be words there to explain what they mean and, additionally, a description of what list you're working under after you enter a list.

Truly the best planning app! I was looking for a planning app with widgets that can change their size. Was harder than I thought! I love that you can see everythubg even in the smallest widget. That was very important to me. What I also like is that you can see all your tasks in a time line sorted by time. This way I don't miss anything. Subtasks and notes are helpful. I like the separate feature for the shopping list! This app is super flexible and intuitive!,Crashes

"Best habit tracker I've used so far! Very flexible, good data to work with, I find it motivating, and I love that I can chose exactly what I want to work on, right away. The price is also very very good for what it is (thank you for not making it a monthly subscription!!). The ONLY reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I love using the widgets however they are quite glitchy. For example today I have 1 habit that dissapeared from the calendar & check off list. Sometimes you can't tick off",Bugs
"I bought the pro version and like it so far. For now what I'm really missing is the ability to change days from the widget itself, with the left and right arrows, and not only from inside the app. Why wouldn't you enable the left and right arrows to change day as default? Having to go into the app to review past or coming days defeats the purpose of the widget, and forces you to use something else other than the widget itself. Other than that, the app seems to be very practical. If the ability to swipe from one day to the next day or to the last day from the widget gets implemented, it would be a 5 star app for me. Thanks.",Crashes

"For me, the best app for organizing your life. But some things should be improved though: 1. You can't set Monday as the first day of the week. 2. Having some of your notes appear both in Planned and Tasks and some in Planned but not in Tasks is bewildering. Besides Planned and Tasks there are two more lists - My Day and Important. Why so many overlapping lists? 3. You can't change fixed time for reminder alarm. For example, ""tomorrow"" is always at 9 a.m. You can't change that to, say, 10 a.m. 4. You can't set quick alarm. For example you can't type some note and then tap ""remind me in half an hour"" or in 15 minutes, in two hours etc. There's no such option. 5. You can't insert a photo or voice recording into your reminders. 6. You can't protect your reminders and notes with a password. Anyone can read them.",Crashes
"I missed my work today because of your stupid ""weak alarm"" method. This means I've lost some money. Notification reliability should be of paramount importance. If something doesn't work 100%, remove it. Very disappointed. VERY! Edit: I didn't get any warning, nothing. If the other option is the recommended one (which I hate that it adds an alarm icon in the status bar. other apps work without doing this), it doesn't mean the other one IS NOT WORKING. Bad. I'm forced to use the stock alarm for the first event in the morning to be sure, which is very inconvenient",Complaints
"I installed and then uninstalled it. Unless I am mistaken, there is no way to edit day-by-day deviations from a routine.

I've been on Android 7.0+ since I started using the app, but regardless, I checked and permissions were set and allowed the app to provide notifications. Still didnt work.

"Nuisance app. It probably works fine, but it's definitely not for me. However, when I decided to uninstall it, it gave me no easy way to delete my account. To delete my account I need to enter a password. I never set a password because I signed up with Google. So I have to login to create a password just to enter password to delete the account.

Tedious and annoying to use. Went back to using Google Keep.,Complaints
"Perfect for people who want to get organized and desire an app more robust than a checklist. It has profound customization ability. The reward system is more complex than competitors. For someone with significant attention issues, this has really helped me to feel invested. Subtasks and autofails are great features. Would be 5 stars if developers: 1. Allowed subtasks to renew as collapsible tasks not just tied in 2. Made tutorial/videos. Full functionality will be a learning curve for many",Bugs
"It's a good app to block your phone if you want to focus for some time. The thing is, it is not as good if what you want is to stop over-using your phone altogether. Also the last change of moving certain tree species (most of them, almost all) to premium is kind of lame, since so many functions are already only available for premium accounts. Couple that with how much time it takes to get a tree and this change seems unnecessary (since use time also means more adds watched and more revenue).",Crashes

"Sorry but the migration from Wunderlist made some things worse. The architecture stays the same and this is good but there are some things that are doubtful unfortunately. Why do I need to flag each task to make it appear on ""My Day"" ? If I assign a task for today, I want it to appear already in ""My Day"", otherwise what's the point of this ""My Day""? Not too many customization possibilities, the look of the app is a bit bulk and not so elegant. Some reminders are not working. I hope this can help",Complaints

Set up was glitchy. I didnt get further than that. It's a great concept though and the art is cute.,Bugs

Will give 5 star if: We can edit a recurring event for today only. Changing recurring event changes all the future event as well.

"Very good functionality, but let down visually. I'm not sure why you can change the colour of everything accept the task itself. When you use the widget the only way to color tasks on the same list is by setting the priority (which changes the tick circle color) but is limited to 3 colours, there's no way to change the colour of the text or background. You can add a label but that does little to influence the look of the actual task. Very odd! Also on the widget cannot remove the 'today' text",Crashes

"This app seems great. i've seen other apps gamifying your life, but what i feels really works, is that you can make a party of friends, and get productive together, while clearing dungeons and getting loot. if you make a group of friends, be aware that even if its just your friends in the group, a single swearword will get you banned. not a warning or anything, straight up banned. i got banned because i called my close friend a F-word C-word. mind you not in public, but in our little group, where that sort of banther is normal between us. Mind you, i'd never talk to anyone like that in a public group. i don't mind policing the language of users if they are abusive or using foul language like that in public, but to me its a bit much to ban people for a private conversation, where there was no victims, but its not within my power to change the community guidelines. hopefully i'll get unbanned so i can give the app a swing. it does seem great. only 3 stars for being so quick to jump the ban hammer. will definetly change stars for the better, if the community guidelines loosen up in regards to private conversations and partys. maybe add a report button instead?",Crashes
I have updated routines and enabled it in programmer. I dont see any in my schedules. Schedules is totally blank. Later it got updated so changing review to little better because. But from the previous design to now i feel like i have to enter so much. Something is wrong with the app.,Crashes

Love this app! My go to for organization,Praises
"I really love this app, but it's not perfect. Here's my thoughts: Pros: - Allows you to make reminders either a push notification OR AN ALARM. This is VERY hard to find in a reminder app. - Highly flexible and customizable, allowing you to set priority, add sub-tasks, custom snooze lengths, etc. Cons: - Not a super clean interface. - Not always an intuitive interface. - The widget often gets behind. Overall, great for someone looking for a very flexible app, but not for a minimalist.",Praises
"Coming from Wunderlist I really tried to like Microsoft To-do, but it's horrible! The layout is so full and depressing. I hate the whole design: colours, choice of font, amount of space wasted. Wunderlist was so much better. My Day is the most useless thing ever. It's cleared out each day, so don't add anything when you're going to bed and want to plan tomorrow. It's all gone after midnight. Why wake something that worked so well for years and destroy it? Uninstalling this app.",Complaints

"Perfect except for 1 thing. The app is great for syncing and task organization etc except for a persistent reminder option. Some apps, like bz pro, have the option where you can click on the reminder in the status bar to read it; or accidentally touch it; but the reminder won't disappear from the status bar until the user pushes a button to actively dismiss it. There is an ongoing notification on this app but the upper limit is only 2 hours after a timed task. It would be 5 stars but for this.",Praises

"A decent app for its intents and purposes but I struggle to stay invested. It's visually good, great icons and colours, also has a nice selection of skills. My biggest issue is the navigation.

I have the premium version. I had been using Wunderlist. The most amazing Todo app ever and very intuitive. Tick Tick has worked well as Wunderlist is no longer supported.

My main issue is that changes in events, especially recurring events do not synchronize and I have missed deadlines because of this. It's no longer trust worthy. Google calendar works find, so until this synchronization issue is fixed, I'm back to using Google calendar. Update 24-08-2020: Synchronisation of ""changed"" recurring events seems to be beter today; fingers crossed. I've updated my rating.",Bugs
"I have been using this premium version of app from past 6 months and its really great, but i still believe there are few feature still missing in it to make things easy. Like there should be dashboard which gives details of all habbits progress in bar percentage marked successful. Currently you have to go to each habbit and check the status. So a centralized section giving more details on the progress would be helpful like it is in Habbit tracker app. Also a dynamic habbit counter could be added",Praises
"Edit: the app gets better with every update and I hadn't had any bugs for a while now. I absolutely love how it looks after the latest update - super clean and fresh. 5 stars and many thanks to the hardworking devs. Love habitica. I find the app often has one bug or another from update to update, so can't really give 5 stars, but the devs do a smashing job regardless so 4 stars from me.",Bugs

"Good app but it would be great if we could add categories of our own..also some more widgets would be useful..such as one for tasks and for a single habit,etc..and it would be awesome if there was like a sharing board..to share our progress with other users if the app and compete with friends in a group and be accountable for each other..it would be reallly helpful in the habit forming process..

Tried removing the widget and adding it again, tried stopping all services, tried re-installing, nothing works.",Other
I love this app for easily tracking my habits to work towards personal goals. There's only two things that could make this app better: being able to disable decimals on specific habits (to count full numbers would be great as you do sets of a workout and make updating the count easier) and not losing the progress of a goal if you change the specifications to meet it (like going from doing 10 to 20 pushups a day and not losing the streak from before the change was made).,Crashes

One major issue though is I can't select the quantity to use for consumables. If you decided to put in 1,000 credits in there, you'll have to click 3,000 times to use it. Takes the fun out of it.

"Clean, simple interface. Generally fast and easy to add things as I think of them. However.....I wish the app didn't think it was so smart. I find the auto-spelling annoying. Putting in 8-10 ft. electric cord under lists was automatically interpreted as August 10th. And the assumptions about categories for shopping lists is annoying. 5 different things to get a hardware store end up in 4 different categories.

"Trash. Yes, it has some nice nifty features but it lacks in complete necessities to actually plan your day. You can make a task, perfectly include subtasks and then add a nice color to the task. But no yellow, because that's already the fixed color of the 'priority label'. Reminders are great, except you can only have one. If I want to have a reminder on Wednesday 10AM and a reminder on Friday 6PM, I'd need a different app. Because this app only allows you to set 1 reminder. Frustrating. 0/10",Praises

It's a good app I do use it alot but there are problems with it like if you put 2 or more reminders in a habit the notification won't work. And my other problem is with the premium.

I've been asking the developers of this app for YEARS to add the ability for the user CHANGE THE TEXT COLOR of the day numbers in month view.

"I upgraded to Pro after a couple of weeks & initially excited about the app. Having used it for a while now I'm starting to regret my purchase. There are some pros but more cons. It's buggy, doesn't sync well at all across devices, the UI is very cluttered, the forum needs serious updating, a search tool for eg. The last update was ages ago, given how pricey this is you'd think the developers would make it worth it but they seem to have disappeared!",Bugs
Great Tool,Praises

"The UI looks good but can be confusing. The different labels (programmer, etc.) don't make much sense in the context of the app. You can't check an item as 'done', and if something in your day changes and you need to adjust or reorder your routine for one day, you can't, which makes the app a bit useless.",Crashes

"I LOVE this app. It was the one I narrowed down to after having downloaded several to-do apps. HOWEVER, I wish it had just a plain note taking feature for day to day things to remember, without it being attached to a to-do item. I also wish the interface was slightly easier to manage, there are a couple fixes that would increase the apps ability to be intuitive for the user. (An easier way to undo checking off a list item, being able to view the agendas differently ie calendar and tasks)",Praises
I already had bought the full version and now I have to pay again which is whatever. But furthermore my calendar is missing most of the appointments and recurring events that I had before.

"Perfect for people who want to get organized and desire an app more robust than a checklist. It has profound customization ability. The reward system is more complex than competitors. For someone with significant attention issues, this has really helped me to feel invested. Subtasks and autofails are great features. Would be 5 stars if developers: 1. Allowed subtasks to renew as collapsible tasks not just tied in 2. Made tutorial/videos. Full functionality will be a learning curve for many",Bugs
"Honestly, just an incredible app. You've never seen more features or ways to organize your life in a single place. I use it in conjunction with the Desktop app, and it's quickly become my go-to. No ads, tons of features, and no bugs as far as I can see. Download it!!!",Bugs

I get a notice that my phone is blocking the app, but there are no instructions in the troubleshooting for my pixel, I've looked all over my settings, there's nothing I can find to change to ""allow"" this app to do something.

I had to go back in and turn off alarms for previously saved events (that I had alarms off). And it would NOT let me create an all day event that was only scheduled one day. No matter how many times I changed the dates it kept including the day before in my ""all day"" event. And then when I would try to edit it, it would change completely to two days before.

When finally found, there is no simple way to unnest the subtask to the root level. Please please fix the selection feature making subtasking more explicit with a larger drag threshold. Bug #2: cannot paste a text in the problem reporting form. It only allows to select and copy the placeholder text. Why?🤔",Bugs

"I bought the pro version and like it so far. For now what I'm really missing is the ability to change days from the widget itself, with the left and right arrows, and not only from inside the app. Why wouldn't you enable the left and right arrows to change day as default? Having to go into the app to review past or coming days defeats the purpose of the widget, and forces you to use something else other than the widget itself. Other than that, the app seems to be very practical. If the ability to swipe from one day to the next day or to the last day from the widget gets implemented, it would be a 5 star app for me.

"Great app, BUT the update has ruined the functionality of the widget. I can no longer figure out how to select multiple tasks, and it is no longer possible to go straight to the app from the widget.

Love it! I hope we get more stickers but its great.,Praises
Pretty good app! Will recommend over others.,Other
"Awesome app, the only missing thing is that you can only set a date, I would like to have buttons to remind me later on the day. Or on the next day, or next week. UPDATE: No what I meant, is that I want to say remind me today and not remind me at date today at specific time. UPDATE: I would then receive the notification, at a specific time 5 hours later or something that can be altered in the settings. And also I don't want to put in a date! Look at the app TickTick has exactly what I want. :)",Other

"Fun and engaging way to track your goals and form better habits. I'm still not great at keeping up with it, but the app works well when I spend the time to pay attention to it.",Praises
"The concept is good and it's really helpful to have project tabs. However, it's really confusing when your completed tasks simply disappear? It makes your progress really difficult to track.

I contacted TickTick through the app and by email and have gotten no response. I use my to do list for everything and can't have service issues like this. Will not be renewing.

"OK sorry, I am not sure whether you are serious or deliberately misunderstanding me. Wunderlist could share lists with people inside my organisation (i.e. colleagues) or outside my organisation (I.e. family). It seems ToDo can ONLY share lists with people that are within my domain AND have a Microsoft account. Will this ever be changed? Please see the thousands of requests for this feature on many forums. I cannot believe you actually misunderstand this request.",Crashes
"Calendar integration is okay but buggy and quirky. Can't see calendar events in daily view without changing settings to show in all lists. Organize view can't use custom lists to plan my week. The sync with Google is unforgivably poor. If I change a calendar event it takes up to a day to reflect in TickTick. This is so bad I have begun looking for replacement.

"Really good app, both when it comes to managing tasks and tracking habits. It supports language input when creating tasks such as ""every Monday"". It also has a few useful widgets for the home screen. Only bad thing about this app is that you have to pay if you want to get access to all features, but it's not that expensive and the app is really good even without premium so that's why it still gets five stars from me.",Complaints

Not bad,Complaints
I bought this app some years ago and stopped using it because it was not compatible with my work exchange account. Productivity was way down because of using a multiplicity and some really bad apps. Now it supports it and I am using it again. And I love it every bit as when I left it. Thanks so much for this app! I got an issue with the hide calendars bar though. It shows entries but I cannot delete entries from the menus..,Bugs
Awesome experience 👏,Other
Update: June 2020: do not use this app free version. It recently started forcing full screen ads that lock your screen for the duration of the ad. Original review from 2018: Great app! Very customizable and the ads are small and non-intrusive. I've been using it for years and had only 1 issue that was resolved after contacting customer support.,Bugs
"I seriously don't understand. The basic functions of the app are so janky and broken. In the avatar creation, I had to keep pressing the options I wanted over and over for it to actually work, then when I finished the avatar had options I didn't pick. Every habit defaults to being both positive and negative. I know there has to be some default, but it's kind of weird that if I have a positive habit I have to tap the negative button. Adding tags is really clunky because the tags have to be added to the filter, (I guess it works but it's unintuitive to have to add a tag to the filter instead of just tagging the task itself) but when I add them they don't immediately get added. They disappear and then get added a few minutes later. Half the time it won't let me move around the tasks. Sometimes the FAQ text pops up overlaying whatever screen I'm on. Switching between habits, dailies, to-dos, and rewards is finicky. Sometimes swiping doesn't work, sometimes trading the icon doesn't work. I have to tap things in the equipment menu multiple times for them to work. Same for the avatar menu. With patience all this stuff does eventually work, but it's tedious to just use the app. The app would be 10 times better just by fixing the buggy menus",Bugs
"It has many features. Still getting used to it. So far, so good.",Other

are not saved. Several times I thought I created a reminder only to find it

After 7 years of using Business Calendar it no longer allows me to insert new events. Is there a problem? Please advise.,Bugs
I love the layout and different features. Two things that I would love changed or added are: 1. The ability to either edit a routine for a singular day or to clear a routine from a singular day (like when I have an atypical day and can't follow my regular routine); and 2. The ability to see the overlap in events/routines if two different things occur at the same time.,Crashes

I was working around the changed, now cumbersome, reschedule/edit/rename tasks process. But Labels beyond a few characters are hidden now. Todoist Labels was The Thing for this app for me, with efficiently visually seeing/grouping tasks. Had made app ahead of many others.

"**UPDATE**. I uninstalled this app. It now causes my phone to crash when I reboot-which is everyday. *******I downloaded this app because the other app I was using wouldn't always notify me. Also, they recently decided to change from an analog clock face to having to scroll (similar to a digital clock) to set the due time. I tested this app before I started copying all my tasks, but I came across a problem. When creating a repeat, there is no way to set it to do a certain day of the month (ie: the 3rd Saturday of the month, or the Last Sunday of the month). This is a big issue for me because I have certain things I want to do, but it's not always on the same date of the month. Hopefully, this can be added/changed soon.",Bugs

Asks for a subscription to get all the features. I'd pay a one time fee only. Guess you don't want my money bad enough. Edit: yes I know which is why you got a negative review. I like your app. I don't like paying subs. I raised u to 3 stars for taking this so we'll. All to often devs get all butt hurt. Add a feature to buy a lifetime license even if it's 20 dollars and I'll buy it. Or give us an option to see ads without a sub at least. Cheers. Do this than 5 stars.,Complaints

"Very nice app with a bad drawback: today's repetition for a recurring task will not appear unless I mark yesterday's task as done! Here's how this is very bad for me:  - I have many recurring daily tasks, and it's a very tedious job to mark all my recurring tasks as done, even those that were NOT done! It gets much worse if I don't use the app for a few days! Then I have to mark all recurring tasks as done for every and each previous day!!!!  - The app forces me to record false information! A task that was not done on a specific day, should stay there as NOT done, and the recurring task should be generated for the following day.  - You have only 3 options for a recurring task: 1) to mark it as done in order for it to appear on the following day. 2) not to mark it as done, and it will never ""recur""! 3) to delete, and it disappears, and naturally, it will never ""recur""!

1) Bugs: to-do list, and dailies keep being empty. Refreshing doesn't work, only close and reopen app.
2) Monthly subscription seems highly excessive - I don't like paying for a service that remains static. This could, and should IMO, be an offline app. Particularly with the existing obvious bugs, payment is out of the question right now.

I started using this app in 11th std & I'm getting its benifit but the only thing is that it doesnt shows the tasks we have to complete in some monutes or if two tasks are to be completed simultaneously in a hour.

It's amazing ok I was really happy with the ability to create list and then a task and furthermore a subtask with a customizable reminder for each However the problem start there when you turn off the pop-up notification and only rely on the regular notification panel it just shows the the subtask name with no additional infos of the main task or the list not even the tag or the customized color is included with it I really sometimes find it difficult to identify the subtask hopefully you fix it,Bugs

"I had pretty high hopes for this app, but the Passcode feature doesn't work. You set the passcode, close the app. The next time you log in, with the passcode, you get an error stating your password has been changed. You then have to sign in with your actual password. If you close the app again, you get asked for your passcode --NOT your passWORD. But your passcode doesn't work anymore, that time. So you get locked out and have to uninstall the app entirely just to get back into it. The passcode option is useless. IDK how I feel about the rest of the features.",Bugs
"Features are really awesome but the app takes forever to open. By the time it opens up, I have already lost the task to be written. I opted out of premium after getting so tired of the app freezing on my phone and on the web. Again the app has really good features but the performance issue is a killer because the whole point of a productivity app like this is to get things done. Would give it a 5 star when this gets fixed. Please look into it and solve this churn problem to get your users back!",Bugs

"Day 2 of trialling this. So far I've had two location reminders fail, I can't label a location with more than one letter, the only time based reminder that's fired did so while on a phone call so I don't know what it sounds like, not that I can change the sound anyway because the instructions don't work. I had no idea what the buttons meant so the first one tapped the task got snoozed for 28 hours. How is that a typical snooze length? Adding anything more than a basic list item is not intuitive",Crashes
"Annoying backup system. I've had installed this app and logged in with Google account once. I also tried some of the app's features, but I uninstalled again because of reasons. After some times, I decided to install it again. So I made my tasks and the others without logging in first (because I forgot).

There is another very simple interval timer that I like but having them separately is nice unless I can set something like that up to trigger within my schedule. This is one of my favorite apps but I two started so this might be seen. I am having a little trouble buying the pro version since another account has my trusted funds.",Bugs

That's EXTREMELY confusing as for a simple thing like this. Don't want to do this again.",Complaints

One month is the same price as a month of Netflix and a year is £47. A year of MS Office 365 with all of its functionality is £60... Let that sink in.

First off, when setting the default notification to x amount of minutes before, it would make most sense to also have a notification the moment it actually happens, or at least have the option to do so without having to do it manually for every single entry.

A great app. I just downloaded it and I already love it. The only issue here is slight ui bugs. November 2017 gets covered up by the tabs at the top and on the day section the date runs into the calender layout. Again great app but those errors make the app look less professional.

"I love this app! My only problem are the widgets for the app. Each widget freezes after non-use for a while. When the widget freezes, I can't mark complete or incomplete update my counting numbers for any of the habits and then I have to physically open the app to update habits. After I do that, the widgets work again until the cycle repeats itself.",Bugs
"My rating to this app just dropped from 5⭐ to 1⭐ mainly because of this company's marketing strategy on how to pressure someone or the previous users to buy their pro version. There were many beautiful trees in store where you can purchase for free with free version. Now, it's only possible by having the pro version. It's quite disappointing that this app doesn't allow you to feel motivated and pull you down by offering their worst trees masterpiece. I won't give my 5 ⭐ till this issue FIXED!",Bugs

Helps me focus on my work but the downside is whenever I close my phone it takes 10 to 15 minutes and shuts down maybe this is because of my phone or something but nonetheless I enjoyed using it.,Praises

"Hi. Long time TickTick user. Unfortunately the app still has big issues with subscribed LOCAL calendars. Recurring events from the local calendar are doubled in the list view and have been for a long time now. The last time it worked properly was in 5.2.1. I notified you guys a long time ago, but it hasn't been fixed. I finally tried Any.Do and it works properly with my LOCAL calendar so it seems that I will be giving them my subscription money this year.",Bugs
"Really difficult app to use. Loads of problems and shortcomings. For example, there's no calendar so one can't go back to the day a task was set. I'll give it another week or so but if I haven't got to grips with it by then I will delete the app. This app is far too difficult to use for my little brain (IQ 147) so I have uninstalled it.",Bugs
"This an amazing calender, my only problem was I was looking for a calendar for solely for my business , because this app you must sync your calendar it becomes useless because now you have your personal calendar mix with business. Useless for that purpose I can just use my Google calendar.",Bugs

Awesome! Syncs could be faster though. Habits take too much time to sync and some completed tasks on the laptop sync very late sending a barrage of unnecessary notifications on the phone or vise versa. Amazing response time of support and dev teams,Praises
"Would give it full stars but the app crashes as soon as I open it now (so I can't use it), hoping that will be fixed in an update :) Edit: for some reason I can access the app through the widget and edit the tasks but as soon as I try to click the home page it fails to load and crashes",Crashes
Tasks in All tasks group is frequently disappearing & reappearing so kindly fix that bug otherwise app is great,Bugs
"it was good until the recent updates. i installed this app because of its widget. however, the recent update destroyed everything that i have customised. there are a lot of setting to make the widget looks good but the update limited the setttings. i event went all out in purchasing the app thinking it could be like it used to be, maybe i can change it back with unlimited setting, but it's not as good as before. im disappointed",Crashes
I think this app is the best option for a to do list except that the sync is terrible. I just paid for premium and the app will not sync. During the trial the sync between android app and PC app was also very bad. If they could get the connection/sync issues fixed it would be a great app. If I can't access the premium features I paid for in the next few hours I'm going to be requesting a refund...,Bugs

"It was so good and then the PC version became extremely annoying overnight. I'll add tasks in a project, the app will sync and move the task to an entirely unrelated project on its own. And sure, I can reassign it, but I didn't have to before and that's just an annoying waste of time. I don't mind waiting for it to get fixed, but I might just start looking for a new app, which sucks because I really liked this one.",Complaints

"Lowered the score after seeing no highly needed feature updates after 8 months. Had to switch from Wunderlist. To Do -still- lacks functions which make Wunderlist so great. Importing worked well, but sharing previously shared lists required me to make a new 'personal' account - this wasn't an issue before. All is set up now and the app -still- feels limited still.

Last updated 2018 really!!!! I am a premium user and it crashes sometimes. Bad investment.,Crashes
NOBODY USE THIS APP. Read all the forums. The app does not support the sync once you've bought premium. Everyone's saying the same. And the devs DO NOT RESPOND TO HELP REQUESTS. I have an error that makes me unable to sync due to a connection error though clearly I am connected to the internet. I am a premium user. The app is great but please help me with my problem. I'm tired of taking screenshots of all my pages every week as my remedy for the sync error.,Bugs
"Ad-free, sync with cloud, can manage recurring tasks (interface not suitable for beginners), widget is functional. Premium is very expensive, licence for home-use missing. However the free version misses some very basic features to force you to the premium. Greatest mistake: no way to backup / export my own data unless I pay. Don't be greedy - it is my data, and you lock it away. Missing auto backup in the free version is OK. But no way to export / download it is a no-go.",Praises
Addition of day counter for negative habits will be great. Also any option for writing notes for failures in habits will be useful. And widget isn't working.,Praises

"I have been using this premium version of app from past 6 months and its really great, but i still believe there are few feature still missing in it to make things easy. Like there should be dashboard which gives details of all habbits progress in bar percentage marked successful. Currently you have to go to each habbit and check the status. So a centralized section giving more details on the progress would be helpful like it is in Habbit tracker app. Also a dynamic habbit counter could be added",Praises
"REVIEW UPDATE: Not sometimes, now it's frequently happening that I can close the forest app and bypass the whole purpose. I can then use my phone to its full extent and forest is absolutely useless to me. I will have to try some other app. Old review: Sometimes the app lets me open apps and get through.

"Absolutely amazing. A simple design that allows you to organize your task into a list that you can format however you want, and see on your phone, computer, or Android Wear.

"Very bad app. I organised all of my activities, took me 1 hour to complete my planner, then realised that the app automatically sets the time at am, so all my afternoon activities where at the morning, for example if I had to eat at 1pm it said that I had to eat at 1am, so I changed them to pm and suddenly the app errased my whole schedule. WASTING 1 HOUR",Crashes
I do like the app. It's fun and has me coming back after I do something. But I would like to get gems without purchasing a subscription. I'm fine if it's slow but I kinda wish there was a way,Praises
This app has a great ui and ux but there's one thing that really makes it useless. I'd doesn't sync in the background so I add a tskl via desktop it'll probably not show on my phone unless i open the app on my phone. It makes the app risky if you need to count on your reminders. Another problem is the time suggestion when you create a task is always behind the keyboard and it's hard to use it like that/,Bugs
"Via Google assistant, not good. I get the feeling from the current reviews that people are using the app and not Google Assistant. My first experience via Google Assistant has been horrible to say the least. The voice assistant in this app he's badly programmed and kept on misunderstanding what I was trying to do as simple as create a task, complete a task, read task list.

Used this calendar for years without any issue. Now ads will take over the entire screen after entering an appointment in the calendar and there is a delay before you can cancel them out. Terrible and disappointing choice on the part of the developers. They've lost me as a user as I refuse to pay for a pro version for a simple calendar app. Do yourself a favor and stay away. The ads suck and are annoying.,Bugs

Reminder feature is not working 🥱,Complaints
I really like it. The reason I'm giving a 4 star is that I wish the focus promo could be set for more than 120 mins. 120 mins means I've got to keep changing it againg and againg for longer focus periods which breaks the focus. P.s. I'm using the free version. I don't know whether it available on the premium version or not.,Crashes
"I don't know why they changed it, but I hate the fact that you can't type in the time anymore. You have to scroll, like you're on Wheel of Fortune or something.

I've been asking the developers of this app for YEARS to add the ability for the user CHANGE THE TEXT COLOR of the day numbers in month view.

Heyyy dear Developers..!! Love the app.. but have a issue in it.. IDK if it is only with me.. the App doesn't show any reminder after 1 day of setting a habit goal.. only 1st day it does..,Bugs
"This is a great to-do list app. However, the competition offers a lot of features for free which are premium here. This app should offer atleast reminder functionality for free. Maybe they can limit the amount of reminders and projects that you can get in the free version which might make it a compelling app. Right now, in the free version, you can just create lists and projects which are viewable in the widgets, but a reminder should be there even in the basic version.",Praises
"'It's free, forever' but 'reminders are a premium feature.' Hmm. I'm dyspraxic, without much money to waste, and I'm looking for a to-do list app to help with this. Without reminders, this app is functionally useless to me. Disappointed that you've opted to content-carve to this extent, and I'd argue your claim of being free is misleading. Please reconsider which features to gatekeep, because locking basic functions behind a paywall makes me *less* likely to support you financially.",Praises
Excellent program and several YouTube videos to better understand the use of the software.,Praises
Resonse (2/13/20): I know that the free version is not ad-free.  The issue that what you have done recently is to force people to watch ads instead of just clicking them away.

"Guys - I really want to like this app more and give it 5 stars! Everything is there and I can see the work and effort that has gone into making it so thank you so much! But on Android the habits screen is quite buggy and won't let me adjust the streaks. The keyboard comes up but closes immediately so I can't do anything. The dailies work fine. I look forward to any updates you're planning but considering this is free, I think what you've achieved is great!",Bugs

It's Chinese so fear of data security issues. Uninstalled it,Bugs
The invite user feature is horrible. You can only do it through email as the text option doesn't work. I used to be able to select a user in the app and they would be notified in the app. I was a user of Wunderlist and this is a step backwards as far as I can tell.,Other
It's fine. The widget does not allow for refreshing and the auto refresh never happens quickly enough if at all. If there was a way to get to the app from the widget it would be whatever but you have to go find the app to go into it which is :/ the app definitely has it's uses I'm sure but I have to uninstall because we use the widget and if it's not functional it doesn't work for us,Praises

Amazing app.. One request from the developers.. This app is turning humans into better humans so 'the rouge' class should be renamed to 'the Ninja' or something as it affects the subconscious brain of users without even them noticing it..(this pure psychology) And this is how low of attraction works.. Never talk or think of things which you don't want in life.. You yourself would not want anyone to be Rouge. So please give 'ROUGE' SOME positive polish.. If you can. Only a humble suggestion.,Praises

"Some pretty basic standard features in other apps are missing. The options menu is very limited with no option to default a tasks due date, project, category etc. These have to be entered every single time a task is created which makes adding quick tasks on the fly very annoyingly slower than other apps. There is no sorting options or filters on views (ability to create custom views does not exempt this feature from being useful). Too many clicks to edit tasks, eg notes/comments, rescheduling.",Complaints
"Trash. Yes, it has some nice nifty features but it lacks in complete necessities to actually plan your day. You can make a task, perfectly include subtasks and then add a nice color to the task. But no yellow, because that's already the fixed color of the 'priority label'. Reminders are great, except you can only have one. If I want to have a reminder on Wednesday 10AM and a reminder on Friday 6PM, I'd need a different app. Because this app only allows you to set 1 reminder. Frustrating. 0/10",Praises

"Updated review: I have used this app for half a year, against my better judgement.  I have sent eighteen bug reports to the devs.  Little.  I could easily send another twenty more, but it isn't worth the time.  This is simply the most bugged piece of software I have ever used.  The avatars are hideous.  The only good thing that this app has going for it is the clean user interface, and a clever separation of the to-do list into three sections.  It is missing some pretty basic to-do list functionality.  The game loads slowly, and doesn't work without an internet connection.  Some of the bugs I've experienced: Reminders pop up on random days, no matter how many times I readjust their settings. Constantly having trouble connecting to the servers. Visual bugs: shows one item, but you get some other item.  Newly equipped main weapon won't show on avatar until app restarted. Progress bars for quests spaz out every time you open the page. Keyboards won't go away once they pop up. And the list goes on and on...",Bugs
"Excellent idea but poor execution. There really isn't much to do game wise 
especially since the majority of the content is locked behind a paywall. I 
understand that they have to monetize it but at 1 million users, ad 
impressions may have been a better route instead of a subscription service 
that locks out the majority of your player base from the start. There's 
also no way to earn crystals other than paying. With so little to do and so 
much unavailable unless you pay (with no options to try before you buy) 
gives me little motivation to come back. Some advice: ●Make the quests you 
can buy with gold cheaper. 200 coins takes forever to grind and there's not 
much to do otherwise. ● Have a way for f2p players to earn crystals (maybe 
through daily login bonuses, level up bonuses or grind and buy them with 
gold). ●Offline capabilities especially for checklists and tasks. I 
shouldn't need the internet to check off my to do list. ●Have the ability 
to choose your class at the start and allow players to change class 
whenever they'd like. Having to wait until you're level 10 is too much of a 
grind. ●Have a little more customization available from the start (maybe a 
freeby starter egg or a background or outfit). Literally everything is 
locked behind crystal pay walls...even the character backgrounds are a 
whopping 15 crystals . That just screams greedy.",Crashes

A search option for icons too maybe? Keep it up!",Praises
"Very good functionality, but let down visually. I'm not sure why you can change the colour of everything accept the task itself. When you use the widget the only way to color tasks on the same list is by setting the priority (which changes the tick circle color) but is limited to 3 colours, there's no way to change the colour of the text or background. You can add a label but that does little to influence the look of the actual task. Very odd! Also on the widget cannot remove the 'today' text",Crashes

It gets much worse if I don't use the app for a few days! Then I have to mark all recurring tasks as done for every and each previous day!!!!  - The app forces me to record false information! A task that was not done on a specific day, should stay there as NOT done, and the recurring task should be generated for the following day.  - You have only 3 options for a recurring task: 1) to mark it as done in order for it to appear on the following day. 2) not to mark it as done, and it will never ""recur""! 3) to delete, and it disappears, and naturally, it will never ""recur""!

Mind you, i'd never talk to anyone like that in a public group. i don't mind policing the language of users if they are abusive or using foul language like that in public, but to me its a bit much to ban people for a private conversation, where there was no victims, but its not within my power to change the community guidelines. hopefully i'll get unbanned so i can give the app a swing. it does seem great. only 3 stars for being so quick to jump the ban hammer. will definetly change stars for the better, if the community guidelines loosen up in regards to private conversations and partys. maybe add a report button instead?",Crashes

Can't rely for reminders. No alarm comes even if I select Alarm. Because of relying on this app I missed an important task.,Other
"This is a bad app. After purchasing a paid subscription, I got a lot of ads instead of an app that helps me plan my business.I hardly see the task scheduler, just advertising. A lot of advertising. The authors are too greedy.",Complaints

"1) If I want to be in leaderboard, I need to give the app permission to all of my private things. No thanks. 2) The achievements always show there's a new achievement unlocked, but there's actually none. This bug is often fixed and then reappears, which is annoying. Otherwise the app is alright. Lots of bugs but they get fixed fast. The part I hate most is the privacy issue because I used to be encouraged by the leaderboard, but I'm not going to give an app such access. Sad. I miss the feature.",Bugs
"I regret buying this app. (TL;DR: don't use this app if you ever intend on changing routines or planning.) Changing existing routines is very hard as it simply deletes whatever overlaps in time. So unnecessary and impossible to revert. If you accidentally click PM instead of AM once, your whole day is deleted permanently. Also, every time I want to sync between my phone and my tablet I have to export it to Google Drive and then import it from the other device. Also, you can't copy items or days to another time.

Bad reviews are a real turn off for me.,Complaints

"New update made me little bitter(in routine section ) ,kindly take it back and give the old one. In the routine section , first the app allowed me to edit the routine of daily easily and separately , but now all the days are one by one and not side by side , actually side by side is best and easy to edit , thank you for your reply :-).... Before it was as free but now as constant ad is placed below which is so annoying.",Complaints
"Great idea, riddled with bugs. I can't use the app at all without an data connection, which is annoying because there's no internet related interface that I've seen so far. I have notifications set up that work maybe twice a week. I really want to use this app, but the bugs make it hard.",Bugs

Update Oct 6, 2020 latest TickTick update is worse than previous versions. I'm afraid I'll be seeking a new ToDo list app.",Crashes
The app is good but the reminders for some of the habits are not working. I have bought the pro version.,Complaints

I wrote down many things and then opened in my laptop, nothing was there although I clicked sync and connected to internet properly. Still the tasks were not synced to my laptop.

"Now there are ads. I have used this app for years and there were no annoying ads. Now i randomly get a full screen ad with no way to dismiss, after saving a new calendar entry. Bad move.

You set the passcode, close the app. The next time you log in, with the passcode, you get an error stating your password has been changed. You then have to sign in with your actual password. If you close the app again, you get asked for your passcode --NOT your passWORD. But your passcode doesn't work anymore, that time. So you get locked out and have to uninstall the app entirely just to get back into it. The passcode option is useless. IDK how I feel about the rest of the features.",Bugs
Edit to reply: You never used to need all these dodgy permissions. What changed? Why do you need to read my notifications now? Update: used to love this app. Now it needs a bunch of sketchy new permissions to do the same job it used to do: keep you from using your phone. So so disappointing as now I have to let the app read all my notifications (????) or it becomes useless.,Crashes

I would have given it 1 star. But it has kept some things. Looking for new, more dependable calendar app.",Complaints
"Good app, but very buggy and support is completely unhelpful. There's no way to change your subscription level in the app or play store.

When using a choosing skill the habits n dailies show up like 10% of the time and the devs basically said ""oh well, we can't fix that"" when I mentioned it.",Bugs
"It's really a big pity that the app does not have badge icons.🙄 Otherwise it would be perfect, especially the custom recurring date option, which is a rarity.

"Simple, reliable and syncing with Google calendar. Love it so much.",Praises
"Every update have been a step backwards. All the small changes only made everything less convenient and looks like will only continue to do so. The last straw for me is now you can't add things quickly (to default ""inbox"" project) anymore, now you have to spend several more clicks to designate a project, even though I just want to add quickly to the default inbox.

I really like it. But there's one or two thing's that need to be addit. I Personally use it to make a list of book that planning to buy and read this year i know there's other apps for this but love the check list style but i don't like how it get deleted after 30 day at most it will be great if there is Option for never delete Plus adding a imagine option will be nice like wallpaper behind the task name,Praises

I would only suggest that they change all the tasks paid options to the free app, so we could have the opportunity to compartimentalize the complex tasks in projects and also to repeat the tasks daily or weekly, to achieve milestones and to track them. This app would become exceptional and dependable. Thank you, I know you will ponder my suggestion 🙏🏻😊",Crashes

updated:. was confused that the event list in the actual app wasn't showing events scheduled for the next few days. The widget will only show events in the next 12h. The event list in the app also only shows events in the next 12h. I think this list should list events for that entire day. this means i still depend on other apps for an agenda view.,Other

I really like it. But there's one or two thing's that need to be addit. I Personally use it to make a list of book that planning to buy and read this year i know there's other apps for this but love the check list style but i don't like how it get deleted after 30 day at most it will be great if there is Option for never delete Plus adding a imagine option will be nice like wallpaper behind the task name,Praises

Initial upgrade hid the separation of today tomorrow upcoming and someday. After sorting and adding new tasks all of sudden they all showed up again. Don't know why this happened. If these features go away it will make this app much harder to use. The bug freaked me out and cause me to write a very bad review which I have since edited and amended,Bugs

"This is a very helpful and fun way to get yourself in the habit of doing things. The Daily Tasks are a fantastic way to get your daily stuff handled and check them off within the app. You've got the ability to create To-Do lists with due dates and notification reminders can make it ridiculously simple to get even the most complex task completed.

"Cant even get past the first screen. I get a notice that my phone is blocking the app, but there are no instructions in the troubleshooting for my pixel, I've looked all over my settings, there's nothing I can find to change to ""allow"" this app to do something.

Please give a short answer of you'd like me to send you an email with the list of my thoughts. :)",Praises
Truly the best planning app! I was looking for a planning app with widgets that can change their size. Was harder than I thought! I love that you can see everythubg even in the smallest widget. That was very important to me. What I also like is that you can see all your tasks in a time line sorted by time. This way I don't miss anything. Subtasks and notes are helpful. I like the separate feature for the shopping list! This app is super flexible and intuitive!,Crashes
"I like it, it's very useful, but I hate that shows my e-mail address, I don't want others to know my address, and pisses me off that the app doesn't even have an option to hide it. When you solve that I'll rate 5 stars. at the bottom it displays a bar with 3 labels, calendar_displays, my e-mail (which I don't want to show), and birthdays. I don't share but I have to show my schedule to some people some times and I don't want them to see my e-mail.",Complaints
"I ended up giving up on this app. A few years back I used it frequently, and now recently I came back, but it's just incredibly frustrating how it always returns server or internet errors and doesn't save my changes. It's a real pity because it was a very fun app to use.",Bugs

"Revised review: Sometimes we seek out apps to help with deficiencies or make life work out. App was so great and so functional for months, until a few days ago. I was working around the changed, now cumbersome, reschedule/edit/rename tasks process. But Labels beyond a few characters are hidden now. Todoist Labels was The Thing for this app for me, with efficiently visually seeing/grouping tasks. Had made app ahead of many others.

"No way to change the font size, so most of my events just display as ""Meeting wi..."" which is basically useless. Can't even click on the event to see, I have to go to a different calendar app to see what I have to do. Which is the one thing a calendar widget should do for you.  Edit: in response to the creator's response to my comment, it IS important to keep in mind that this is a free app, with no possibility to upgrade, meaning this is not a professionally-developed app, so there should be no guarantee or expectation of quality. So if what you're looking for is a free app, then this might be a good app for you. However, if you're looking for a calendar/agenda app, then probably not.",Crashes

I love the layout and different features. Two things that I would love changed or added are: 1.

The ability to see the overlap in events/routines if two different things occur at the same time.,Crashes

Going back from a task edit screen without making any changes also asks (shows popup) whether you wish to save or discard changes, that popup is irritating. Otherwise an effective and the point app. Cheers!",Crashes
I actually loooooove the app and use it to organise my life but it has now stopped updating as a widget. If I make changes to my lists on the app it will not change on the widget?,Crashes
use Google tasks instead,Other
very bad experience,Complaints
This is beginning to change my life.,Crashes
"It's really a big pity that the app does not have badge icons.🙄 Otherwise it would be perfect, especially the custom recurring date option, which is a rarity. I give four stars though - as the app is really cool. Ps. Badge icons are the little red dots with numbers in them on the top right part of app icons/widgets showing missed calls, unread messages/mails, upcoming/due tasks etc.",Complaints
will be 5 stars if it can be backed up via cloud,Other
I keep tapping and it's just unresponsive. It seems like a fun app but to keep tapping and not getting anywhere is annoying It just stops... Please fix seems like a fun app to try out,Crashes
"Earlier this app used to have a large varieties of trees available, which could be bought by the coins that you collected from your study sessions. But now, all those varieties of tree species can be unlocked only after buying their PRO version. So there isn't really much use left of the app if you dont want to get the pro version",Other
Its good but not that much because after completing the tasks they didn't appear in the list it must be in one frame at a place down in the list . Secondly it doesn't provide u the notifications properly it just ring like a bell that is for a single second,Other
"I've been using this for a long while now and it remains the penultimate, perfect to-do list app! I recommend it to pretty much EVERYONE I talk to, especially friends, family, and coworkers. -- 4/18/2020: latest update has eliminated the ability to resize widgets as needed. The remaining options are too large or too small.",Other
Not so great. The user interface is not friendly. Making the to do list takes far too long and theres no way (that i found) to make a list that repeats daily. I'll just stick to google keep.,Praises
no bad,Complaints
"Forces you to sign up and use credentials, uninstalled.",Complaints
Confusing and clunky.,Other
"Since last 2 updates I am facing this problem that when I open the app, one or two tasks get shuffled to the top. Then I have to put it again in the planned sequence. This happens almost everytime I open the app.",Bugs
"Perfect for people who want to get organized and desire an app more robust than a checklist. It has profound customization ability. The reward system is more complex than competitors. For someone with significant attention issues, this has really helped me to feel invested. Subtasks and autofails are great features. Would be 5 stars if developers: 1. Allowed subtasks to renew as collapsible tasks not just tied in 2. Made tutorial/videos. Full functionality will be a learning curve for many",Bugs
Simple to set up and use.,Other
"Has some unchangeable unfeatures like not showing appointments marked with other than ""default"" privacy, as well as appointments marked as ""available"" - instead of ""busy"". That's all work hours I have set apart for clients but not allocated yet - important information to me.",Crashes
The only thing not working is the reminder.. I'm using Huawei Mate8.. Can somebody help me how?,Complaints

Standard above average,Other
"I simply love TickTick but am growing weary of the widgets not updating. If I open the app, they update after a minute or so. However, if I don't need to use the app (therefore not opening it), the widgets stop updating after some amount of time. Is there a setting I'm missing, or do I need to ""not optimize"" TickTick's battery use? EDIT: In addition, actions taken via the widget do not update the app/website until i open the app explicitly.",Praises
very bad experience,Complaints
Bad and have ads,Complaints
"Great tool. I use it every day. There's a bug, however, that's very annoying. I'm on Galaxy Note 9. When I move the items, there's 80% chance the item will loose previously assigned datetime and will be moved to the Someday list. It's very annoying and time consuming! This is the sorting mode by Time. Additionally, when I choose this mode, majority of items belonging to various lists, unfortunately, will not be sorted by date & time, so I'd have to move them manually... Please fix these issues",Bugs
"Need Wifi/Data for it. I get that you can play with your friends, but it would be nice if I could use it without wifi for data anyway. I have a limited ammout of data and brain memory. So by the time I get home after all day I've forgotten my habits and the point becomes mute. Only gave this an extra star because I love the 8 Bit art.",Praises
"Awesome app to gamify tasks. I've been using it for 3 months and I love many things about it. I won't write them because I can only type 500 characters. BUT I wish it could include ""time tracking"", like the one from Toggl. Also I strongly wish it could have a desktop version (and IOS). Another thing would be to sincronize with a google calendar, not only the one inside the app (I also think the calendar needs accuracy). Lastly being able to interact with other users and a ranking would be great.",Praises

It really is worth it to download this app. Thank you for designing this wonderful app! Thanks so much,Other
"I purchased the paid version and I'm sort of disappointed. Every time I enter a task it adds the first letter of the first word over again so I have to change it each time (i.e. it will autocorrect to EEvery instead of Every). It is also kind of laggy. It could be a great app, but not as is.",Crashes
Absolutely love this app it is so simple to use and it will remind you of everything ! I would recommend this app to anyone,Praises
"It's a great app. Thank you. I wish it would let me to write time and cost of each task I list, so I could calculate how much I need to invest, also it would be nice if I could organize my tasks based on priority and change their priorities if necessary.",Crashes
the current day shows events for the next day and seemingly no option to change it. very annoying.,Crashes
"Worst Experience Ever. I signed out, & All of my Tasks list Gone.... Login bar doesn't even showing what email it was. And I don't remember my email. I was going to buy this App, but hate now. Don't have any way to backup my list.",Complaints
Premium should be free,Other
"Is there no way to assign a specific color to an event? I like to group my meetings by color. If I can't do that, the app isn't useful for me.",Other
"This app seems great. i've seen other apps gamifying your life, but what i feels really works, is that you can make a party of friends, and get productive together, while clearing dungeons and getting loot. if you make a group of friends, be aware that even if its just your friends in the group, a single swearword will get you banned. not a warning or anything, straight up banned. i got banned because i called my close friend a F-word C-word. mind you not in public, but in our little group, where that sort of banther is normal between us. Mind you, i'd never talk to anyone like that in a public group. i don't mind policing the language of users if they are abusive or using foul language like that in public, but to me its a bit much to ban people for a private conversation, where there was no victims, but its not within my power to change the community guidelines. hopefully i'll get unbanned so i can give the app a swing. it does seem great. only 3 stars for being so quick to jump the ban hammer. will definetly change stars for the better, if the community guidelines loosen up in regards to private conversations and partys. maybe add a report button instead?",Crashes
Been using this app for for years now and I really love it and help me organize stuff/schedules.,Praises
I love the widget but whenever I edit an event on the calendar it changes the day to like the day before without me doing so and it's extremely annoying,Crashes
I began using this app 18months ago after having a baby and feeling that i was never feeling organised. It has been a game changer in helping me schedual all of the little things and keeping me on track,Crashes
"Love the app, but frequent changes to the UX are frustrating. I manage to get used to changes, develop some muscle memory, and more changes come. The new snoozing experience is very slow! It may be flashy, but it's just painfully slow, it's an added inconvenience. Please at least make it an opt-in feature.",Crashes

"I used to love ticktick. I have it on mobile Android and Windows 10 client. They used to sync beautifully. Around 23 Aug, the desktop client and mobile stopped syncing and acted like two separate accounts. In desperation, i reinstalled desktop client. I couldn't log into client nor thru browser. It complained of network configuration and proxies. i don't use proxies. I can log into any account online except ticktick. The help rep is unresponsive. Super disappointed. I'm on premium. I want refund",Crashes

"It's a lot of fun, good personalization. I have to make time to explore the app called more fully, I think a tutorial would be amazing, and pre-developed lists that could be tweaked.",Praises
It has changed how I viewed my different lists. Now they are all jumbled together and I can't find what I need.,Crashes
"I've been using this app for more than 5 years, it was great. But currently I changed my phone and found out that syncing doesn't work anymore :( It says something like ""no internet connection"". So at the end I have to use another app.",Crashes
"UPDATED: After getting feedback from the developer I now see that you can set up repeat tasks, you just have to set a due date before the option appears. I use this app almost daily and I love the ability to have sub task lists. Now that I know how to set repeat tasks I anticipate using it even more. Thank you Stephen for reaching out to me and helping me with your app. Got your fifth star up there now. 😄",Praises
"Great idea, it needs some improvements imo. Edit: after playing for a while i noticed some things that definitely need improvement. Faster loading times when changing sections or when receiving items, you shouldn't have to refresh to see them. That also applies when feeding pets where i dont see a progress in the bar unless i refresh. Etc.",Crashes
"Very bad premium services, developers are not taking care of this app anymore",Complaints
"I've previously written a review as well as updated it, which I will continue to do - I believe in this app's potential.  One of the more persistent problems I've faced is with skill point distribution. Sometimes when I go to check the related skills of a repeating task (because I'm not seeing the related skill points on-screen upon completion), I notice that the related skills percentages have been reset. I have to manually change the percentages back which can be pretty time consuming, especially when it keeps happening. I really wish the devs would fix that.  Also, a suggestion: I would love to see time/date for my tasks in the widget and notification windows.",Bugs
What is 599 error??? It just stop me using this app!! Hate that!,Bugs
"new update is full of bugs, pls do something",Bugs
Keeps on crashing :(,Crashes
"I absolutely love this app. I am using for a couple weeks and it is really helping me with my tasks. I tried similar apps and they're not quite as good. Tasks are highly customisable and gives tons of options. So why not 5 stars? Well, there are some issues, but please take them as constructive criticism. 1. It is not respecting the silence mode. 2. Steep learning curve. (Worth it though) 3. Auto failing task with subtask is not working. I will promptly give 5 starts when #1 is fixed!!!",Bugs
Just give an option to go back to the old version. So unsatisfied and feel demotivated after the new update.,Other

"I love this app, it's the only one I've found which combines tasks and habits in a simple way. However, I do get frustrated that I can't seem to change the scheduling of a habit after I've set it up. E.g. If it's set for once a week and I want to make it twice I have to delete it and create a new one. Can you please fix this",Crashes
No doubt this app is amazing. And this app deserve 5 star but I am frustrated because this app doesn't keep log more than 90 days. I wish it could kept forever.,Praises
I am also looking to change after years of usage. The app stooping to advertising unless a NEW upgrade is paid is dishonest. I paid for my old version and was satisfied with its functionality. Not interested in your new version,Crashes
"Honestly, within a month of trying this, the app just got annoying and boring.",Complaints
"I'm going to start by saying who segments their hours on a clock into fifths? That's not standard and just annoying. Second, why can't I add events from the app? It ALWAYS redirects to Google Calendar, so what is this app even good for? I'll just use my calendar, AND it will be easier......",Complaints
Very very very very very very bad or should I say the worst app I have ever seen. It doesn't let me sign in and even create account even if I agree every condition. I was so excited to try it after reading all the reviews but it is useless!!! 🙄🙄🙄🤬,Complaints
"The mobile version is great, but is there a reason that the web interface is suddenly so slow and unwieldy? It's been a few weeks now, so I'm deleting this app and creating lists on a new app, in case anyone has any recommendations.",Praises

Support tablet landscape mode please. Uninstalled,Complaints
"Perfect for me, takes some serious investment to set up proberly, but absolutely worth it. However, the impact of skill increases on characteristica is not calculated properly and totally different percentages turn out with the same fraction of exp (or identical numbers with a totally different fraction of the exp). Further more, when i use a task that gives me 100 exp, my herolevel gets stuck at 90/25 and doesnt update anymore. If these minor bugs are fixed, i will provide the 5th star.",Bugs
A very good to do manager. I would take a premium version if on the Windows version it would possible to set/change/manage location reminders. For this feature I already wait some years. I'm really surprised that the programmers are not able to add this feature also at the windows app. It's annoying so anoying that you have to edid every task in Android again to add a location reminder..... But it seems to be to difficult for the programmers...??? So when this is to difficult what can we expect? Will the maintanance of the Windows app stay on a reliable basis??? Waiting already since years for a change. Didn't know why the ask me to change settings on Android to change place reminders on my Windows TickTick... May be I should give up 18.10.2019,Crashes
"This app is able to sync across your devices and has a simple user interface. Still, I'd like greater organization facilities than are currently available. I wish you could assign tags on items in different lists and then filter by tag. For example, I have a work list with my tasks in it and I'd like to assign tags corresponding to the work sub project the task belongs to.",Praises
"It's hard to not get bored when I being serious on something. So, I always think that life is a game. And this is a great app that can help me to get rid from my boredom when I build my good habits. Thank you very much for the developer. 5 stars from me. 😊🤩",Praises
"Nice, but crashing",Crashes
"The app is not working well since the latest update (2.37.0): the app crashes a lot when creating or editing tasks, the reminder for tasks and meeting are not working (notifications are enabled), so that makes the app useless. Reinstalling the app doesn't solve anything.",Crashes

"""When you view a project, you'll no longer see all the tasks in its sub-projects."" - Mit diesem kurzen Statement wurde ein Kernfeature der App einfach ersatzlos gestrichen und zerstört somit sicherlich nicht nur meinen gesamten Workflow. Auf Nachfrage beim Support bestätigt dieser, dass man noch nicht genau sagen kann, ""wann genau"" ein ähnliches Feature dahingehend kommen wird. ""Generell zukünftig"" hieß es da nur. Da diese Anzeigeweise auch zentraler Part mehrer Projekte war, die ich mit Nicht-Premium-Nutzern teile, stellte ich dem Support des Weiteren die Frage, ob das irgendwann zukünftig geplante Folgefeature auch wieder für Nicht-Premium-Mitglieder verfügbar sein wird. Die Antwort darauf war, dass es egal sei, wenn ich ein Projekt mit einem Nicht-Premium-Kunden teile, da Premiumvorteile immer genutzt werden können, solange man halt eben Premiummitglied ist. Dahingehend also Danke für nichts.  Schade. So gern ich die App auch immer mochte: So kann ich sie nicht mehr benutzen und bei der gezeigten Reaktion des Supports will ich das auch nicht mehr.  ## Edit: ## Die Methode von Doist funktioniert natürlich auch nicht wie gewünscht, nämlich nicht mit Non-Premium-Kunden. Siehe Oben.",Praises

"Easiest way for me to use Habitica. Simple but motivating. I'm not sure if moving the plus button to the center was a good idea, it covers more of the text of the tasks there.

Asks for a subscription to get all the features. I'd pay a one time fee only. Guess you don't want my money bad enough. Edit: yes I know which is why you got a negative review. I like your app. I don't like paying subs. I raised u to 3 stars for taking this so we'll. All to often devs get all butt hurt. Add a feature to buy a lifetime license even if it's 20 dollars and I'll buy it. Or give us an option to see ads without a sub at least. Cheers. Do this than 5 stars.,Complaints

Even after your response it doesn't change the fact that you are required to have an account to proceed. The reasoning that others do it is negligible. Only way I would rate this app better is if you had an Anonymous auto log in that can be converted to a full account on sign up or log in.,Crashes

"Really don't like that they changed the empty time slots back to the way they were (whenever you delete an activity the activity gets replaced with an empty block separate from the empty blocks before or after it), I find it to be extremely unnecessary.

I even tried to make the alert noise silent but it kept doing the sound even after I changed it. Made sure every single thing was changed to silent but that didn't help.

This is good effort for developer to create this app but can pls fix all the issue...may seem minor but to me it's confusing and thus rendering it less useful. tq.,Bugs
"I noticed a slight anomaly in the app. If you start focus for a subtask e.g. SubtaskX of TaskX, then why isn't that focus time added to the total time of TaskX? That SubtaskX does fall under the TaskX, so any time invested in SubTaskX should also be added into the main TaskX otherwise it defeats the whole purpose of SubTaskX if it is independent of the TaskX.

Truly the best planning app! I was looking for a planning app with widgets that can change their size. Was harder than I thought! I love that you can see everythubg even in the smallest widget. That was very important to me. What I also like is that you can see all your tasks in a time line sorted by time. This way I don't miss anything. Subtasks and notes are helpful. I like the separate feature for the shopping list! This app is super flexible and intuitive!,Crashes

Great app but the fact I can't see my recurring tasks for example for the whole month to know if I'm free on specific day in the future insteas I need to check week by week is a deal breaker although I did pay for the premium and this feature is not avalible. Will give 5 stars if this important feature is in the app.,Praises

I downloaded this app after hearing good things about it. I had todoist and my subscription ended and I wanted to try this. I downloaded it and brought over all my lists from todoist. After entering everything I uninstallled todoist (bad idea). I decided to upgrade ticktick to premium. Once I upgraded they asked me to sign in which I did. Upon signing in it deleted all the items I had in the app already. Contacted support. Haven't heard back from then yet. What a way to thank me for upgrading.,Complaints

"Widgets don't work unless you open the app, and sometimes you then you even have to take an action or two within the app. Wish this product was maintained. Have emailed the developer, but they didn't get back to me. The app doesn't even support logging out, anymore. The usual uninstall/reinstall didn't work.",Complaints
"The presentation is slick, highly customizable and the skills and characteristics offer an encouraging meta to ""just do one more thing before bed time"". Liking it! It would have been an easy 5 star if not for the widgets. Unfortunately they do not continue the established level of customizability. Especially rescaling elements of the Ui of ""All Tasks"" to fit it into a smaller screen is missing. Further, there is a bug that ""All tasks are done"" after clicking away two tasks. Oxygen OS 10.3.3",Bugs

"It's pretty neat. I love the how everything pops out on the clock. Only thing is I tried scheduling things after 12 PM and it wouldn't pop up and I notice it only shows 12 hours at a time. If you buy the pro version it comes with the 24 hour feature, which I think is totally worth it. Seeing 24 hour option you can see everything from start to finish and not miss anything.",Praises
It's slow. It'll be better if it works offline,Complaints
"I like this app, I have used it for a while now and it helps. Only reason for 4 stars is that the percentages are frustrating. I managed 122 days straight but it won't change from 98%. I think once you do the full 66 days you should get 100%. Also, would love to be able to highlight a day in the future as a milestone, just different colour so I can say 50, 100 days etc, as a motivator.

It would be nice if challenges were visible from the app in all of the guilds, and I would also like to see the last day and time that a habit was marked, because the colors don't always change and if you have a lot of habits it gets confusing. Otherwise, this app is brilliantly done and will be getting my monetary support in whatever way I can afford.",Crashes
"Update: After I read the reply I redownloaded this app. Waste of $4.25! It's NOT WORTH ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY! Not a lot of extras to charge money AND it's only cute on a computer. The ""lists"" are not very easy to make and I never did find the ""meal plan"" or journal parts. The goal part is not on the app. Any.do is FREE and a lot easier for lists with reminders and also includes a calendar. Not worth the cost. Yeah it's cute but not as easy to use as other free calendars. Pretty disappointed...",Other

"Very good functionality, but let down visually. I'm not sure why you can change the colour of everything accept the task itself. When you use the widget the only way to color tasks on the same list is by setting the priority (which changes the tick circle color) but is limited to 3 colours, there's no way to change the colour of the text or background. You can add a label but that does little to influence the look of the actual task. Very odd! Also on the widget cannot remove the 'today' text",Crashes

I even tried to make the alert noise silent but it kept doing the sound even after I changed it. Made sure every single thing was changed to silent but that didn't help. It's also stopped popping up the notifications when I DO have a task so I often miss things. I'm going to be uninstalling this app and finding one that actually works.",Crashes
"Ads are becoming really invasive and you have to wait at least 5s each time before you can skip, see another ad, then come back to the calendar. Not inclined to buy pro with such bad user experience... Edit : And most people use a calendar app once or twice a day, so I guess dev are aiming for maximum ad visibility... I know nothing is free but this is annoying, and it's video ads for silly games. I guess I'll uninstall soon..",Complaints

I love this app for easily tracking my habits to work towards personal goals. There's only two things that could make this app better: being able to disable decimals on specific habits (to count full numbers would be great as you do sets of a workout and make updating the count easier) and not losing the progress of a goal if you change the specifications to meet it (like going from doing 10 to 20 pushups a day and not losing the streak from before the change was made).,Crashes

Nice idea for an app but don't like the fact that you can't customize the hero to be a woman. Also think the interface could do with an upgrade for a better user experience and the app could do with a lot more refining over all to improve it. Edit - but there are no female icons.,Other

This concept is amazing, and the idea is just brilliant. However, this is by far the buggiest app I've ever had on my Android, and the UI is just not well thought of. Guys, please work on the bugs so I won't have to click 1,000 times before I get feedback that something happened, won't have to reopen the app and lose all the initial welcome tour with all the choices, won't have to use my full name without being able to change it because I signed up with Google....

This basically is just a purple version of Google calendar. It has the almost exact same layout as Google calendar without any extra features. I wanted to use this as planner for school seperate from my calendar but there was no way to have it not sync with Google. Don't bother getting this app just use calendar directly.,Other

Just installed and am liking it so far. I do wish there was a way to disable the quotes and better utilize that space to see more of my actual calendar. Also sub tasks would be very useful. With those changes I might actually be able to downsize the apps I use.,Crashes
"I've used this (Pro) version for years and it does everything I want, including syncing well with multiple Outlook and Exchange calendars. My only gripe is that if I need to make entries or edits to multiple appointments or events, the app freezes after a few entries and I either have to wait for several minutes (even if I kill the app), or reboot to get the calendar back.

"I LOOOVE this app! It would give 5 stars, if only it would work😦. It's 
been bad for crashing for months, but I put up with it because I use it so

stars!!!",Crashes
"it is too slow, regeneration takes too much time",Complaints
Love this app and use it everyday. Very simple and straight forward.,Praises
"I really love this app, but it's not perfect. Here's my thoughts: Pros: - Allows you to make reminders either a push notification OR AN ALARM. This is VERY hard to find in a reminder app. - Highly flexible and customizable, allowing you to set priority, add sub-tasks, custom snooze lengths, etc. Cons: - Not a super clean interface. - Not always an intuitive interface. - The widget often gets behind. Overall, great for someone looking for a very flexible app, but not for a minimalist.",Praises

I submitted few complaints but there are more",Complaints
Generally it's satisfactory calendar app. Variety of features with clean and productive design. The only problem is the support. Recently there are ads quite frequently popping up in the app. When I wanted to upgrade to PRO app shows some technical issue on their side. I tried to contact support but answer was general and didn't solve the problem at all.,Bugs
Great app... Exactly what I wanted... But it needs frequent troubleshooting owing to some reason unknown to me! Also the programme facility needs subscription which is not economically viable for students like me...,Praises

I'm still trying to figure out how to customize this app to suit my needs, but since I don't have the Premium app in order to do that, I will be uninstalling this app.",Complaints
"The app does not synchronize events and tasks correctly with Google calendar. Often the changes I made on my desktop computer are not displayed in the app until the next day, or do not synchronize at all until I manually request BC to sync.

Really enjoying using this planner and now my lists and tasks can repeat it is slowly replacing my old calendar and to-do apps altogether.,Praises

"The app itself is really nice. I like how the widget displays my schedule for the day, it.gives me a very nice grasp of my time. The bad thing is that it slows down my smartphone, I have a S9, and it drains a lot of battery. It makes my phone lag and ""stutter"" when I try to open it. I uninstalled ans reinstalled apps to check my theories, so I uninstalled this one, the phone was doing so much better. And I even PAID for the Pro version!!!",Complaints
This app used to be good when you could add widgets that would show each task you wanted to complete on the home screen. They have since removed that features and you can only add shortcuts to said custom lists. Might as well just use OneNote now. At lest that is used on my PC too.,Other

"this is the best app I have ever used to keep track of my activities.The greatest part is that each time you feel like giving up to achieving your objectives, it will always remind you, which is very motivating. I only have one problem though,having trouble with syncronising my progress, which means if the app was to be accidentally uninstalled and then reinstalled again, then all the progress I had saved would be lost, so this one reason I give you a 4 star rating instead of a 5.Good app though",Bugs
It was good until they introduced long adverts every time you add an entry.... How to annoy your users ! I won't be forced to pay... I have given good feedback in the past and good feedback encourages others to pay now you have decided to make the free version really annoying to use you are creating bad feedback! Good luck,Complaints
"I was excited to use this app and love the categories and reward system for habits, dailies, to-do. After a few days and several rookie mistakes that aren't explained well in the tutorial, I realized this app is way too heavy on the game mechanics for my use. I want to have a list of dailies to partially complete everyday, to encourage reading and writing every now and then, not everyday. This app punishes you for not checking these things off everyday. I totally didn't realize my character was losing tons of health until it hit the red zone. I then started reading up on the death mechanic and am very turned off. I can understand wanting to give the players consequences for missing a task, but it shouldn't be health loss and it should account for how the player uses the dailies (must complete everyday or bonus if completed). They also do not make it easy to provide feedback. All the discussion links either required creating a separate account (different from the habatica account) or were closed threads. This app could be so fun but I feel it loses sight of promoting good habits/organization. I love gaming, but this is super heavy handed mechanics to me. Would keep using this app if I could keep the lists alone.",Praises
Good app that I can use for putting all my appointments in. One problem is that the notifications I set to make sure it reminds me don't go off at all. (I have a Droid Turbo 2). If you guys could fix that. I will change to 5 stars.,Bugs
Can login with facebook because there is an issue with login implementation. Uninstalling,Bugs

"This app really changed my life. I was able to make my life work with this. I've been trying to get my life on track and out of depression, and this app showed me how.

Can you make a NON-CHILD app similar to this but for REGULAR PEOPLE not 5 year old RPG gamers? I avoided yours for a long time but still nothing exists yet for adults. I hate RPG (cause I'm not an anti-social loser) but want to gamify my productivity with public leaderboards in an app. Thanks. Looks well made but I don't want it.,Complaints
I downloaded this app after hearing good things about it. I had todoist and my subscription ended and I wanted to try this. I downloaded it and brought over all my lists from todoist. After entering everything I uninstallled todoist (bad idea). I decided to upgrade ticktick to premium. Once I upgraded they asked me to sign in which I did. Upon signing in it deleted all the items I had in the app already. Contacted support. Haven't heard back from then yet. What a way to thank me for upgrading.,Complaints
"Absolutely amazing. A simple design that allows you to organize your task into a list that you can format however you want, and see on your phone, computer, or Android Wear. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the syncing between devices is a little bit inconvenient. Often, I would make changes to my tasklist on my phone, and they would not show up on computer until I went back into the app and manually refreshed it.",Crashes

Dont know what they did but this app doesnt work on my Android 10 device anymore. Lags for ages then just stops working and shuts down. Not helpful. Now my forest wont grow and will become neglected because I am uninstalling this app next and I doubt I'll ever use it again.,Complaints
"Would have given this app 5 stars but for 3 issues. 1. The ""Notes"" icon keeps appearing next to reminders. 2. The tasks do not appear in order of time, but alphabetically. This is really annoying. 3. The tasks do not appear on the calender, which is also really annoying.",Bugs

It really has made everyday life feel more guided and fun!

Closing and reopening fixes it, but would appreciate it if this bug was addressed.",Bugs

"A negative experience.  I wasn't using it and forgot about it until it was renewing.  I didn't port it over to a new phone and it seems  you can't cancel the app except through the app.  This means I would have to install it on my new phone, give it permission to access my information, then cancel the subscription and uninstall it.

Even after your response it doesn't change the fact that you are required to have an account to proceed. The reasoning that others do it is negligible. Only way I would rate this app better is if you had an Anonymous auto log in that can be converted to a full account on sign up or log in.,Crashes

"Excellent idea but poor execution. There really isn't much to do game wise 
especially since the majority of the content is locked behind a paywall. I 
understand that they have to monetize it but at 1 million users, ad 
impressions may have been a better route instead of a subscription service 
that locks out the majority of your player base from the start. There's 
also no way to earn crystals other than paying. With so little to do and so 
much unavailable unless you pay (with no options to try before you buy) 
gives me little motivation to come back. Some advice: ●Make the quests you 
can buy with gold cheaper. 200 coins takes forever to grind and there's not 
much to do otherwise. ● Have a way for f2p players to earn crystals (maybe 
through daily login bonuses, level up bonuses or grind and buy them with 
gold). ●Offline capabilities especially for checklists and tasks. I 
shouldn't need the internet to check off my to do list. ●Have the ability 
to choose your class at the start and allow players to change class 
whenever they'd like. Having to wait until you're level 10 is too much of a 
grind. ●Have a little more customization available from the start (maybe a 
freeby starter egg or a background or outfit). Literally everything is 
locked behind crystal pay walls...even the character backgrounds are a 
whopping 15 crystals . That just screams greedy.",Crashes

Why so many overlapping lists? 3. You can't change fixed time for reminder alarm. For example, ""tomorrow"" is always at 9 a.m. You can't change that to, say, 10 a.m. 4. You can't set quick alarm. For example you can't type some note and then tap ""remind me in half an hour"" or in 15 minutes, in two hours etc. There's no such option. 5.

"I really wanted to like this app, but it's just too buggy. Sometimes I open the app and it doesn't have the icons to switch views. Also the 12-hour formatting is really flawed. And the priority scale seems way too complex. High, medium, low should be enough for most people.",Bugs

That's just lame.",Crashes

I really like the sophisticated display and the level of personalisation you can make. It would get 5 stars...but....the default text colour for the month display widget is a dark grey that is too dark to read when using the dark theme.

Love the app but i have a question. I have a morning routine set up with subtasks. Is there a way to hide the subtasks from my daily task veiw and only have them show under the master task pulldown tab? Also i would love it if i could order my tasks customly without having to assign a time to them. This is by far the best app i have found for setting to do's for yourself. As an adult with adhd I love the fun childish functionality without it looking like a childs game on my phone.,Praises
"The most fully-featured task tracking app I've seen. A little daunting at first, I recommend ignoring a lot of the xp sliders and special options until you are used to the general mechanics. Once you realize you can ignore or tweak any mechanics you dislike, it's value shines through. There's enough options in the mechanics that you can use what systems you like and ignore the rest.",Complaints

The different labels (programmer, etc.) don't make much sense in the context of the app. You can't check an item as 'done', and if something in your day changes and you need to adjust or reorder your routine for one day, you can't, which makes the app a bit useless.",Crashes
"I liked a lot about this app, but unfortunately, there is no feature to repeat tasks (hourly, daily, weekly, etc), which is kinda vital for me. Without it, I can't recommend this app. Much as I hate Todoist's subscription model, they seem to be the leader as of right now.",Complaints

I was charged for a subscription even though I didn't use the app because I made a mistake in canceling the subscription. I sent an email detailing my problem and asking for a refund.

It's cheap, though (slightly cheaper than the main competitor todoist), so I'm fine with paying.",Complaints

"Works with my Google calendars and has nice planner features. I gave it only three stars because I cannot change my calendar colors. I can change the colors in settings but the first time planner updates, the calendars change back to the default colors. I also paid for the original incarnation of this calendar that they abandon and went to this subscription based one. The version I had eventually stopped functioning as Android updated. I do not trust paying for this after that experience.",Crashes
Even after your response it doesn't change the fact that you are required to have an account to proceed. The reasoning that others do it is negligible. Only way I would rate this app better is if you had an Anonymous auto log in that can be converted to a full account on sign up or log in.,Crashes

A very good to do manager. I would take a premium version if on the Windows version it would possible to set/change/manage location reminders. For this feature I already wait some years. I'm really surprised that the programmers are not able to add this feature also at the windows app. It's annoying so anoying that you have to edid every task in Android again to add a location reminder..... But it seems to be to difficult for the programmers...??? So when this is to difficult what can we expect? Will the maintanance of the Windows app stay on a reliable basis??? Waiting already since years for a change. Didn't know why the ask me to change settings on Android to change place reminders on my Windows TickTick... May be I should give up 18.10.2019,Crashes

I understand syncing is a premium feature, but the backup feature is not and I wish I hadn't bothered with this app in the first place. Edit: In response to your comment, my problem isn't the fact that I want premium features for free, it is the fact that I downloaded this app knowing that it had a free backup feature built-in, which is the main reason I chose this app. Your response shows a lack of professionalism, and frankly, maturity. The premium features do not include a back-up feature, but rather a syncing feature, which doesn't suit my needs. Your app is not the value of a free coffee. The premium features cost $20.99 for a subscription, not a one-time fee. The app accepts donations, but it's also for profit. The description of the app and it's features are misleading, and this is why I am giving you a negative review.",Bugs

There were many beautiful trees in store where you can purchase for free with free version. Now, it's only possible by having the pro version.

"This app is a great idea with poor execution. Reminders only sometimes appear, and the UI can be very unresponsive - I've checked daily tasks off, only to find that the app interpreted this as UNchecking the task (since it hadn't registered the fact that it is a new day, yet), which actually subtracts the game resources from you. These problems are significant enough to make the RPG-like rewards system ineffective for me, and the app not worth using as a habit-tracker at this time, sadly.",Bugs
Bad app.,Complaints
Clean layout and does what it says without egregious permissions. Two thumbs. Unfortunately I can't find information about the app's functions even within the help menu: - Recurring tasks do not appear to reset if they are not complete.

"This would be great if it didn't require me to mark negatives. in other words, it requires me to mark everyday I did NOT do something, such as smoke a cigarette or drink alcohol. This is overly cumbersome over time and is going to cause me to stop using the app because I don't want to have to check everything that DIDN'T happen.

"A core function missing is the ability to disable a routine/ daily 
occurrence for a specific day. For example, I usually exercise from 6pm to 
8pm every day, so I created an event that happens every Monday to Friday. 
Today is a Thursday and due to an unexpected occurrence, I can't exercise 
today. I wanted to change that my 6-8pm block of time just today, but can 
only do so by deleting the event for EVERY Monday to Thursday to clear my 
timeline. Makes no sense to clear that block of time and need to re-create 
that exercise block for all the other Monday to Fridays. If something 
unexpected happens at 6pm next Friday, I'll have to delete it ALLL, and 
recreate all over again after just to clear my timeline. If you get this 
core feature right, then the app would be complete.",Crashes

I like that I can make different lists and sublists of tasks and it's easy to move something from one list to another or cross something off.

Another important feature missing is the ability to tell if I have future tasks scheduled when looking at the calendar. Currently the calander view shows days in a circle. Please colorize the background of that circle if there are tasks scheduled on that day. This is essential in order to know what days i have future tasks scheduled on.

"This app is good but the problem is reminders do not pop on the set date & time, which destroys the purpose. Most of the time it doesn't pop at all. So is the case with Repeat. Apart from Repeating daily, monthly & yearly, it would be appreciated if we had repeats for particular dates in a month/year. As not all tasks repeat in a fixed interval.",Bugs
"This app is very good for keeping on task, and everything is totally customizable. One thing I would improve is the simplisity of it. Right now, it's a bit too much to handle, and if there was an easier way to do things, it would make this app even greater!",Praises

It is better than the normal app in your phone I only wish their was better support for the calendar,Other
I love any do,Praises
"I'm going to start by saying who segments their hours on a clock into fifths? That's not standard and just annoying. Second, why can't I add events from the app? It ALWAYS redirects to Google Calendar, so what is this app even good for? I'll just use my calendar, AND it will be easier......",Complaints

Pathetic app. The date does not change at 12am but it changes at 12pm and the developer doesn't even care to solve the issue. Worst app which doesn't even serve its purpose.,Bugs
"I don't like that it forgets the settings (like repeat, daily, no notification, etc) so you have to change it every time. Also, no way to stop the vibration when selecting certain things. Also, when you add a new event, the date gets to the next day and after it says that you can only input less than 24 hours. Bottom line: good idea, finicky to use.",Crashes

"App was useful, but I was very disappointed when a large number of trees were moved to premium without warning. I had been saving up and watching extra ads for coins for weeks, and then found there was nothing I wanted to spend those coins on. It felt underhanded - I thought the deal was that I watch ads, app gets revenue, and I get a nice tree, but then that deal changed. If you're going to move features to premium it would be polite to warn users so they could spend saved coins first.",Crashes

To delete my account I need to enter a password. I never set a password because I signed up with Google. So I have to login to create a password just to enter password to delete the account. I haven't figured out how to revoke the permissions I gave. This is abusive. Deleting an account and data should be straightforward.",Complaints
I love the app. The UI simplicity and features but If it was possible to add upto 3 contributors in the free version it would have been better.,Praises

Don't bother installing this app. The free version is garbage. Recently the developer made the decision for inclusion of ads. The ads pop up every time you add an event to the Calendar. The developer has chosen to sacrifice usability of the app and consumer comfort in the rush to monetise the app. I have uninstalled it and will not be returning to the app again.,Complaints
Uninstalled. Still cannot remove background to blank. Edit: Yep still the same. Also please put the free backgrounds at the top. This is from only within the app by the way.,Complaints

Several years ago I filed a ticket for a big where it jumbles up sublists. Every few months I check in and out still isn't fixed. The web app is not letting you expand sections. The windows app was scrambling the order for months. They must do zero quality control.",Bugs

This app is adorable but i'll never really use it. Its too bland. Great colors and styles just not enough to keep me interested.,Praises
"Amazing app. One of the main reasons I like having a smart watch is to keep track of my appointments on my wrist, and this has been one of, if not the best way I've tried of having easy visual access to my daily agenda. The visuals is seeing the hand move towards my meetings and the time listed until then is a great touch as well",Praises
"Terrible experience. If you forget to acknowledge a recurring task when it reminds you, it will no longer send reminders for that task. Randomly changes ""remind me when due"" selection to ""do not remind me"". In one week, with 4 tasks per day, it has failed to remind me 9 times. Absolutely useless!

The deal breaker for me was the fact that I can't set custom alerts for calender events.. maximum I can do is 2 days before event.. why can't I customize it (i.e 2 weeks or 10 days)?

The rest of you, stop whining about the free version - if you want to complain, buy it first.",Other
"It seems like the developer is paying attention to customers, which is a good thing. Hopefully they'll respond to the overwhelmingly critical reviews of the most recent update. The checkboxes simply make it too easy to accidentally mark a task as complete. This is a bad, bad deal. I use Todoist to help me more efficiently run my businesses.

The last (but not only) straw was when parts of a menu are rendering in completely the wrong place, and won't clear. Inviting people to your party was way too confusing, until I found out it didn't even work until I did it manually *on the site*. There's more, but I won't bother.

"UPDATED: After getting feedback from the developer I now see that you can set up repeat tasks, you just have to set a due date before the option appears.

looks like it's doing something useful, then nothing happens. I've looked 
and I don't see any setting that I'm screwing up or anything and the 
default functionality of the to do list probably shouldn't require you to 
change something for something to show up anyway. Glad I tried this before

To me that's just a bunch of clutter. Then it was telling me I had five appointments this month, no, only have one, it only showed the one but it still says 5. I don't have a clue what the other four are. Anytime I try to do anyting it practically begged me to join premium, I just uninstalled it.",Complaints
"Loving it so far. The absolute high that I get from checking off important tasks on a to-do list is indescribable. Todoist is my white rabbit. But actually it really is great. Feels intuitive.

How am I supposed to know what task I was reminded about? * I can't add a new task with a due date, e.g: ""test 20:10"" because as soon as I type 20 the "":"" button dissapears from the top suggested keys and is not available from the special keys / second keyboard page either (I use the default/google keyboard so that can't be the issue). * The sync is slow, after I added a new todo on the web I had to open the Wear OS app a few times so my new todo also appeared there.

"I am completely in love with this app. This app has changed my life completely. Which is why I want it to get even better. Here is a small recommendation. Make a 4 week calender system (A/B/C/D week) so that if you want to make a schedule where you take 1 day off after 3 days of work, It is completely possible to make a routine that will keep repeating itself. (4dayx7=4x7day) by simple math, once you get to 5th week, you are back to the same pattern as that of 1st week and so, the cycle goes on",Crashes

I've never rated something on Google Play so for this app to get me to give an amazing rating is saying something. This is my favorite routine planning app because it allows you to set habits and routines in an intuitive way. It allows you to view the progress you're making with habits.

While the game is free, there are certain things you can only get through buying gems. Which is understandable, they need to be able to support themselves&the game.

1) Bugs: to-do list, and dailies keep being empty. Refreshing doesn't work, only close and reopen app.

Same issue as Don Smith who wrote a review on 10/10/19. Will consider this app but the lack of slide visuals and character visuals makes the app in-op. Current phone is the Google pixel 4xl......perhaps I misspoke in regards to the reply. My issue is not with the visuals but the lack of visuals. Everything is blank for me so literally can not see half of the content.,Bugs
There is better google keep than this if you need a free one. You need to pay to use this.,Other
Amazing app.. One request from the developers.. This app is turning humans into better humans so 'the rouge' class should be renamed to 'the Ninja' or something as it affects the subconscious brain of users without even them noticing it..(this pure psychology) And this is how low of attraction works.. Never talk or think of things which you don't want in life.. You yourself would not want anyone to be Rouge. So please give 'ROUGE' SOME positive polish.. If you can. Only a humble suggestion.,Praises

A very good to do manager. I would take a premium version if on the Windows version it would possible to set/change/manage location reminders. For this feature I already wait some years. I'm really surprised that the programmers are not able to add this feature also at the windows app. It's annoying so anoying that you have to edid every task in Android again to add a location reminder..... But it seems to be to difficult for the programmers...??? So when this is to difficult what can we expect? Will the maintanance of the Windows app stay on a reliable basis??? Waiting already since years for a change. Didn't know why the ask me to change settings on Android to change place reminders on my Windows TickTick... May be I should give up 18.10.2019,Crashes
"Really don't like that they changed the empty time slots back to the way they were (whenever you delete an activity the activity gets replaced with an empty block separate from the empty blocks before or after it), I find it to be extremely unnecessary.

Why is break tag forcefully added in all activities? Why can't I remove it? Why deleting tags delete the whole activity? Edit - I don't think you quite understood the problem.

"I have to agree that the full-screen time-draining ads are not viable for a Business Calendar, regardless of the reasoning behind it. By all means, keep the small rolling ads along the bottom of the screen or alternatively charge a more reasonable fee to go pro. £6 is not an option when there are so many other options out there, such as aCal (which I used to use before BC and am now reverting to)... I'll keep an eye on Business Calendar though because, if you change the ad situation or make the pro price more reasonable, I'll certainly be back!",Crashes
Amazing and helpful,Praises

I have the premium version. I had been using Wunderlist. The most amazing Todo app ever and very intuitive. Tick Tick has worked well as Wunderlist is no longer supported. However some key things I truly miss. Push notifications when someone texts within the app. Notification that someone else has updated or completed a task or list. Copy and paste everything I need into a section as a single item in the list instead of everything becoming its own item in a list.,Praises

"Honestly, needs a lot more features for me to be worth paying premium for (I tried out the free trial). The deal breaker for me was the fact that I can't set custom alerts for calender events.. maximum I can do is 2 days before event.. why can't I customize it (i.e 2 weeks or 10 days)? Then they need other things like automatic dark theme switching. Other than that, it's a nice productivity app. Love that it combines tasks and events into the calendar",Praises
"A core function missing is the ability to disable a routine/ daily 
occurrence for a specific day. For example, I usually exercise from 6pm to 
8pm every day, so I created an event that happens every Monday to Friday. 
Today is a Thursday and due to an unexpected occurrence, I can't exercise 
today. I wanted to change that my 6-8pm block of time just today, but can 
only do so by deleting the event for EVERY Monday to Thursday to clear my 
timeline. Makes no sense to clear that block of time and need to re-create 
that exercise block for all the other Monday to Fridays. If something 
unexpected happens at 6pm next Friday, I'll have to delete it ALLL, and 
recreate all over again after just to clear my timeline. If you get this 
core feature right, then the app would be complete.",Crashes
"I really love this app, but it's not perfect. Here's my thoughts: Pros: - Allows you to make reminders either a push notification OR AN ALARM. This is VERY hard to find in a reminder app. - Highly flexible and customizable, allowing you to set priority, add sub-tasks, custom snooze lengths, etc. Cons: - Not a super clean interface. - Not always an intuitive interface. - The widget often gets behind. Overall, great for someone looking for a very flexible app, but not for a minimalist.",Praises
Reminders are not working. I have an Asus ZenFone 4 (shouldn't matter) and I have set the reminders multiple times with no success.

Truly the best planning app! I was looking for a planning app with widgets that can change their size. Was harder than I thought! I love that you can see everythubg even in the smallest widget.

Sometimes when I go to check the related skills of a repeating task (because I'm not seeing the related skill points on-screen upon completion), I notice that the related skills percentages have been reset. I have to manually change the percentages back which can be pretty time consuming, especially when it keeps happening. I really wish the devs would fix that.  Also, a suggestion: I would love to see time/date for my tasks in the widget and notification windows.",Bugs

It would also be cool to see a health bar that represents the amount of time you have in a day to be productive. Have it decrement as time passes and maybe make it adjustable for how much time you have in a day i think another tasklist app does that.

I let them know a couple weeks ago and got no response.",Bugs

I just downloaded& installed this app. I was in search of an app that allows me to insert date and time stamp. Preferably using a button on the screen.

Fantastic app but 4 stars. Every part has been a comfortable experience for me until I started trying to use it across devices. I took me around 30 minutes to set up all my tasks the first time and when I signed into my account for the app all the tasks I had made got overwritten by the default tasks from the other device. It was partially my fault for the careless order that I signed in on the devices. But perhaps my issue could have been avoided entirely if when it attempted to sync my tasks from the internet the first time it asked me if I wanted to use the database that is from the internet or that is local. Would have saved me a lot of headache remaking all the tasks again. That said every other function provided is great and I would recommend.,Bugs

Speaking of tasks, I couldn't set up multiple repeating tasks for certain days of the week (per task, wanted to fill the whole week with various tasks and repeat them) for some reason, they would all sync to same weekdays.

"To be fair, I downloaded it and uninstalled it after a couple of minutes. The reason for this is that I hate apps that scream ""pay me money"" since the instance you download it, and this one did that exactly. With the ""free premium trial"" being in your face all the time, and then setting it up or going through the tutorial you could see all the features and all you could see is ""premium"". Just do the app as a paid one instead of begging for people to pay for it. It looks amazing though.",Praises

"I like it, it's very useful, but I hate that shows my e-mail address, I don't want others to know my address, and pisses me off that the app doesn't even have an option to hide it. When you solve that I'll rate 5 stars. at the bottom it displays a bar with 3 labels, calendar_displays, my e-mail (which I don't want to show), and birthdays. I don't share but I have to show my schedule to some people some times and I don't want them to see my e-mail.",Complaints
"Widget is buggy - a task marked as completed in the app is displayed as overdue, and trying to tick it off in the widget takes me into edit mode. The proper app, when reopened, shows a blank inbox and revisiting the screen is required to populate it again. Poor punctuation (eg. ""28 Sep , 2017” - why the space before the comma) is not that big a deal, but also adds to the app not feeling very ""pro"".",Bugs
"Would have given this app 5 stars but for 3 issues. 1. The ""Notes"" icon keeps appearing next to reminders. 2. The tasks do not appear in order of time, but alphabetically. This is really annoying. 3. The tasks do not appear on the calender, which is also really annoying.",Bugs

"Long time paid user, who is very disappointed with the current version. I have had several events and tasks disappear as if they were never created. I have had this happen for months now and have done multiple tests to see if I am at fault, however, this issue happens at random.

Hey. Will there be no reminder function on this app?,Praises
Have used this app for almost two years. I loved the minimalistic features despite all other confusing apps out there. It would be great if worked on making it an aesthetic user interface .,Praises
really great concept but .......not much useful and not even that beautifully eye-catching thing,Praises
Used to be great until they became too pushy to upgrade to the paid version. Now you need to be on the pro version to buy designer trees as compared to the early days where you could just purchase them even on the free version. Quite disappointed with the development team frankly.,Praises

"This calendar would be a 5 star except for 1 MAJOR issue. The sync is unreliable. For example, items placed on my calendar via Google or Gmail within the previous 24-48 hours usually do not appear no matter what sync settings I have or how many times I manually initiate a manual sync. All other calendar apps I have tried do not have these sync issues.",Bugs
"Dear Habitica, This app is currently impossible for me to use. There is no save OR delete button for editing habits. I checked your most recent reviews and a few others seem to have the same problem. Please, please, please fix this. I will say as well that the first opening of the game feels a little jarring. The editing of ones character feels clumsy and it is definitely not better to start with a randomized character. Give users a blank sheet and let THEM apply changes.",Bugs
"Paid for the pro and im already annoyed. I have several dead trees they want me to pay to get rid of just because I was canceling to fix the ""deep mode"" settings that you cannot turn on after you started, but it doesnt even warn you its not on until you start, so its an automatic failure you can't rid of. Dumbest and most easily avoidable issue",Bugs

"I'm changing my review from 5 to 2. I'm a pro subscriber and love this app, but latest widget changes for Android are truly terrible.

But hey it's transparent now! Horrible update and I hope the team behind this update sees this review.",Crashes
I really like it. The reason I'm giving a 4 star is that I wish the focus promo could be set for more than 120 mins. 120 mins means I've got to keep changing it againg and againg for longer focus periods which breaks the focus. P.s. I'm using the free version. I don't know whether it available on the premium version or not.,Crashes

Now everything is in project folders and I can keep track much easier - one for each of my classes, work, and home. I love it and now I spend less time on my phone and more time getting stuff done. My only suggestion for the Devs is to allow users to hide the large ""labels,"" ""projects"" and ""filters"" folders if we don't use them. I don't like filters and wish I could hide it.",Praises

This application is amazing because it has so many possibilities, like everything is open for you, you can set anything.

So at the beginning it may not so clear, and maybe there are more friendly use apps, but this one in adjustable",Praises

Excellent Application! Would've given 5 stars if the following want such a pain. Would like for it to be easier to remove a recurring event however. That seems to be an incredible pain.

I will have to uninstall now because of this.",Bugs
"I really like many of the function, especially since they are easy to use. Now if I may say, I would like to see a more elaborate calendar set up much like the one used in Google Calendar where the user can see the whole month at once.

"This is the best, most customizable, app around. I appreciate the dev for being on top of responding to feedback and such. The app has grown over the years, and it keeps getting better and better with quality of life changes.

I would love to be able to lay out and plan how my skills level up and progress into other skills. Linking them together and seeing how the diverge and converge.

If the other option is the recommended one (which I hate that it adds an alarm icon in the status bar. other apps work without doing this), it doesn't mean the other one IS NOT WORKING. Bad.

"Good app, but very buggy and support is completely unhelpful. There's no way to change your subscription level in the app or play store. Even if you cancel the app will think you're still subscribed. So basically when you pick a subscription level you are fully committed to it because the devs are too incompetent and uncaring to help. When using a choosing skill the habits n dailies show up like 10% of the time and the devs basically said ""oh well, we can't fix that"" when I mentioned it.",Bugs

Plus if an activity has 3 tags and one of them gets removed doesn't mean you'll remove the whole activity.,Bugs

"Great app! I use TimeTune to time block my entire day into short segments. A few fixes: [ when scheduling a day in advance, the time auto-sets to 24 hours (ending next day). If I scheduled breakfast from 8:00 AM to 8:30 AM, it automatically sets to 830 AM the next day. Very tedious to change.] [difficult to see overlapping tasks] [no easy way to push an entire schedule back, if you are late on one item, and need to push everything by 10 min for example. You have to change each manually.]",Crashes

Left you two stars for old times sake. *Added after Dev response. It wasn't the frequency. It was the advert that was served.

Simply cannot risk this again",Complaints

"Excellent idea but poor execution. There really isn't much to do game wise 
especially since the majority of the content is locked behind a paywall. I 
understand that they have to monetize it but at 1 million users, ad 
impressions may have been a better route instead of a subscription service 
that locks out the majority of your player base from the start. There's 
also no way to earn crystals other than paying. With so little to do and so 
much unavailable unless you pay (with no options to try before you buy) 
gives me little motivation to come back. Some advice: ●Make the quests you 
can buy with gold cheaper. 200 coins takes forever to grind and there's not 
much to do otherwise. ● Have a way for f2p players to earn crystals (maybe 
through daily login bonuses, level up bonuses or grind and buy them with 
gold). ●Offline capabilities especially for checklists and tasks. I 
shouldn't need the internet to check off my to do list. ●Have the ability 
to choose your class at the start and allow players to change class 
whenever they'd like. Having to wait until you're level 10 is too much of a 
grind. ●Have a little more customization available from the start (maybe a 
freeby starter egg or a background or outfit). Literally everything is 
locked behind crystal pay walls...even the character backgrounds are a 
whopping 15 crystals . That just screams greedy.",Crashes

Not linked to multi-accounts, shows all no matter what. Very frustrating. Other than that it's good for quick calendar entries, that's why it's staying. ***edit*** Going to ""settings -> appearance -> filter duplicate events"" gets rid of them. Just don't have muliltiple, exact same entries on the same date. 4* now",Bugs
I had given 5 stars in Jun 2017. I'm changing it to 1 star because of the full screen ads which cannot be dismissed. I'm grateful to the developer for creating this nice looking calendar app and was happy to tolerate the ads in the free version but the full screen ads really disrupt the process of adding an event to the point where it becomes intolerable. I'll just switch to Google calendar which syncs better anyway. Thanks for the few years of a great app.,Crashes
Please add start view that has many favorite projects easily accessible. Would be better if it was possible to add top of the list.

I love the idea but there are syncing issues.  Events take forever to show on the graph regardless of whether i entered them in the sectograph app or my google calendar.  They show up in my google calender almost automatically regardless of the same.  Also i think 12 hour clock makes it tricky to read since the switch from am to pm is in the middle of the day.  I have something starting at 12:30 and i cant see it on the sectograph but there is a little arrow at that start time with the first letter of that event and nothing else.  It's confusing.,Bugs
"Needs a VPN if you're in China. Some questionable UI and design choices, though the fundamentals work well for the most part. If you want to do anything remotely interesting then you have to pay, of course. And the subscription fees are absolutely extortionate. One month is the same price as a month of Netflix and a year is £47. A year of MS Office 365 with all of its functionality is £60... Let that sink in.

"This is the best, most customizable, app around. I appreciate the dev for being on top of responding to feedback and such. The app has grown over the years, and it keeps getting better and better with quality of life changes. It's actually spoiled me from installing other similar style apps again simply because I can just make everything to my taste all in one app. It really makes keeping a schedule feel like less of a chore, and for a gamer like me, that's golden. Real life questing is fun!",Crashes

It's impossible now (after that 'redesign'). // 17.7., 2.3.: I'm pretty sure I WAS ABLE to create/edit a new task in ONE go (and in LANDSCAPE).

"I've had this app for a few years, and it worked well until the last several months - it's gotten increasingly buggy and will do things like ""forget"" you checked off tasks as completed and re-list them as incomplete between closing and re-opening the app.  It also had been freezing more and more frequently, to the point where that happens at least once a day, and now I can't even load certain screens.  Because of this, I will not be renewing my subscription this year and will be using another app.",Bugs

This is a great app with one major downfall. The completed tasks are removed from the list and can only be accessed after a lot of clicks. By default it should stay on the list in a striked out state. It is important to know the tasks which I completed on the day. Hope this is fixed soon.,Praises

"Correct idea worng execution. The watch face UI cannont be operated like manually moving clock hands.

"It took me a while to understand how to use certain features, but once I did I found it to be EXACTLY what I needed! If Google would allow reminders to come through, it would be the PERFECT time management tool! My only thought would be if there was some sort of tutorial or guide to help know what some things were for (like when I'm changing the color scheme, I can't always tell what's what) For those not wanting their calendar clogged up, just make those things hidden after you've added them.",Crashes

I downloaded this app after hearing good things about it. I had todoist and my subscription ended and I wanted to try this. I downloaded it and brought over all my lists from todoist. After entering everything I uninstallled todoist (bad idea). I decided to upgrade ticktick to premium. Once I upgraded they asked me to sign in which I did. Upon signing in it deleted all the items I had in the app already. Contacted support. Haven't heard back from then yet. What a way to thank me for upgrading.,Complaints

However there are a few bugs. Every so often one of my recurring tasks will appear twice on one day and I have to delete it. The synchronization with drop box isn't good enough to use on two devices. I would be useful if you could choose 'third Sunday of every month' for recurring tasks,Bugs
"Negative: increase of ad's, everywhere!! Good: This calender allowed me to organize my day in a clutter-free manner. I was specifically looking for 1 feature: I needed to be able to categorize or tag each event and then be able to toggle them on and off as needed. So, I can turn off all birthdays or repeating events or work items or whatever, OR only see that item. This app allows you to categorize each event as needed. It's a bit tedious to update all of your events but later it's simple.",Complaints
"I love this app! My only problem are the widgets for the app. Each widget freezes after non-use for a while. When the widget freezes, I can't mark complete or incomplete update my counting numbers for any of the habits and then I have to physically open the app to update habits. After I do that, the widgets work again until the cycle repeats itself.",Bugs

Ex: If I have a recurring task set up to complete every 10 days, but I actually go 15 days before completing it, I don't want to be reminded again in 5 days. I want the next due date to advance 10 days from whenever I last completed it.

"You win, take my money. I have been using this app for many years and never bought the upgrade. I recently upgraded to the S10, and between Bixby, Google, and many planning apps, I just couldn't separate myself from this one. I simply have not found an app that's easier to add and complete tasks. Also the task widget is just hands down better than every other one out there. So fine, if you want to add fullscreen ads (and have the audacity to include sound) then take my money you can have it.",Other

There appears to be no way to change this on the settings for my phone or the app. This is problematic for me, because I have the premium version and have it connected to Zapier. I am not receiving push notifications when actions are taking place. Very disappointing, as this is crucial for time management projects with teams.",Bugs

First off, when setting the default notification to x amount of minutes before, it would make most sense to also have a notification the moment it actually happens, or at least have the option to do so without having to do it manually for every single entry. Second there is a lack of flexibility. There should be a way to easily move around and resize items on your schedule without changing the routines themselves.",Crashes

This app is great. I was using different methods to change myself and they all failed but this RPG style game which I can even customize has proved to be most efficient.I would like the app developer to add some more stuff like new acheivements at different levels and getting access to more functions as we level up.😊(it will make app more interesting instead of getting more and more boring every time),Crashes

Edit: in response to the creator's response to my comment, it IS important to keep in mind that this is a free app, with no possibility to upgrade, meaning this is not a professionally-developed app, so there should be no guarantee or expectation of quality.

Same issue as Don Smith who wrote a review on 10/10/19. Will consider this app but the lack of slide visuals and character visuals makes the app in-op.

"Updated review: I have used this app for half a year, against my better judgement.  I have sent eighteen bug reports to the devs.  Little.  I could easily send another twenty more, but it isn't worth the time.  This is simply the most bugged piece of software I have ever used.  The avatars are hideous.  The only good thing that this app has going for it is the clean user interface, and a clever separation of the to-do list into three sections.  It is missing some pretty basic to-do list functionality.  The game loads slowly, and doesn't work without an internet connection.  Some of the bugs I've experienced: Reminders pop up on random days, no matter how many times I readjust their settings. Constantly having trouble connecting to the servers. Visual bugs: shows one item, but you get some other item.  Newly equipped main weapon won't show on avatar until app restarted. Progress bars for quests spaz out every time you open the page. Keyboards won't go away once they pop up. And the list goes on and on...",Bugs

Love this app. Got the pro version. It will save a lot of my cognitive work! Please fix this bug: The colour of events are set to blue when the event is created using the default colour of the (sub) calendar.

What a pity to finally found wunderlist alternative app. However I can't use this beautiful design app because there is no notification for all the activities in any sharing list except directly mentioned that person name. How to mention everyone name in every comment. Come on dev. You can do such a great job so far. This is just a setting to receive notification. Receive all or just for be mentioned. Wunderlist becomes the best because of user feedback. Don't let the world down 🤣,Praises

I am changing it now to 5 stars, because this is still by far the best calendar app I've used!",Bugs

"I'm easily motivated by things like points and streaks, so this app works really well for me to increase my productivity and decrease my anxiety. I use rewards for breaks, and find that I get unpleasant but short tasks done much more often, because I can earn breaks quickly by just getting them over with. I also get my long, complicated, multi-part projects done early. I gave it four stars because there are a couple of features I'd like to see, but it works great as is.",Praises
"I don't do ""free trials"" where my credit card information is mandatory to try it out first Edit:. Still don't like the above but I have to say the app is about perfect for me in every way.

What happened to the repetition option? It disappeared with the last update! Edit: I uninstalled & reinstalled & that fixed it.,Complaints
I've been asking the developers of this app for YEARS to add the ability for the user CHANGE THE TEXT COLOR of the day numbers in month view. The current gray color doesn't offer enough contrast when using dark themes. We also need the ability to add clearly visible grid lines surrounding the day cells in month view. Two very simple requests that go ignored year after year after year.,Crashes
Why this app requires so much of settings in one time.. 1)Like it should be in recent apps..2) If internet is off it doesn't works..3) Even though all the permissions to app is allowed in phone settings.. Than to it crashes.. It requires an immediate update with all the bugs fixed soon. Or people wouldn't even write a review.. They would uninstall the app and find better alternatives.,Bugs
Just installed and am liking it so far. I do wish there was a way to disable the quotes and better utilize that space to see more of my actual calendar. Also sub tasks would be very useful. With those changes I might actually be able to downsize the apps I use.,Crashes

I would have given it 1 star. But it has kept some things. Looking for new, more dependable calendar app.",Complaints

Fantastic app but 4 stars. Every part has been a comfortable experience for me until I started trying to use it across devices. I took me around 30 minutes to set up all my tasks the first time and when I signed into my account for the app all the tasks I had made got overwritten by the default tasks from the other device. It was partially my fault for the careless order that I signed in on the devices. But perhaps my issue could have been avoided entirely if when it attempted to sync my tasks from the internet the first time it asked me if I wanted to use the database that is from the internet or that is local. Would have saved me a lot of headache remaking all the tasks again. That said every other function provided is great and I would recommend.,Bugs

"I love this app, but have one major disappointment - when I input something in the calendar that lasts more than one day, it doesn't show a solid bar of colour from day 1-last day. Usually at least the first or last day (or both) show up as a separate event. It is very annoying and confusing.",Praises
It used to be great but ever since it updated it doesn't work and it let's me go onto other apps while in use which defeats the purpose of the app. I was going to upgrade to premium but now that its not working I don't dare risk it if even the basic features don't work then I doubt that the premium ones will.,Praises
"I needed a replacement for Wunderlist, which we relied on for task lists for our business & employees. With TickTick, I had to manually type in each task for each list because the Import feature only put them in my Inbox. There's no Home Screen - hitting the return arrow exits the app (not a biggie, just an adjustment). The real downer is having to pay to share the lists with more than one person. Collaboration was an important feature we needed. Using Microsoft's To Do for now.",Other

App is amazing but ios version is so much better than android version. It has many other settings while this one lacks them. i hope this gets fixed so i can change my rate to 5 stars.,Crashes
"Love the app, it kinda sucks that they moved so much stuff from the free version the the premium version but the premium isn't really expensive so it's ok. The only thing I'm sad about is that the new trees that have been added recently don't change over time. Whether you plant it for half an hour or two hours, it'll end up looking the same. And that sucks cuz letting my tree be more beautiful if I plant one for longer is a motivation factor for me. So I'd like to see that change :)",Crashes

At first I liked that I could choose to see or hide the done tasks and even the done tasks were on alphabetic order. I use this app also as a grocery list. So every time I want to add the done tasks I have to go throw everything. Why can't you have the done tasks in alphabetic order as well.

If you have money you can have better features and during these times you would prefer to save up. But the app is great I do recommend it.🌻,Bugs
"Dear TickTick please add the 'redo and undo' option, because it's absence I can't recover my just cut data which cut by mistake during 'copy-paste' procedure. Please add this feature.",Other
Nice app. the icon got problem.,Bugs
Initially it was a very great experience with this app but nowadays the app suddenly gets closed and the tree gets dead.,Praises
"It's not bad. But it seems greedy. Like, why do I have to pay to unlock individual color themes if I'm paying a monthly subscription? Also, LifeRPG was so much better than this. More icons to choose from and they were free. If you're going to make an app that copies all the ideas from LifeRPG, at least make it better. Why can't I make an accomplishment like: learned blank piece of music, without having to tie it to accomplishing a certain number of tasks or reaching a certain level?",Complaints
99% percent love this app! I would like the option to turn off the vibration that occurs when moving a task from one sublist to another. It's annoying to other people nearby when I'm using it in a quiet place which stops me from using it at certain times of my day. Otherwise fulfills all of my to do list and note taking needs.,Praises
"The latest update has made my mobile sync completely non-existent. I even uninstalled, cleared junk, restarted my phone, and re-installed, but that actually made it SO much worse -- the app now thinks I'm horribly behind on repeating tasks that I deleted months ago.",Complaints
"Great, does the basics I need it to. Tricky to move tasks to folders?",Praises
I was little starting to be comfortable comparing to other app..unless the premium came up.. I don't any personal ac to pay just to get reminded 🤧where multiple remider doesn't work..i literally start loving and hate at the same time..u can't get multiple unless u get premium..:) this ain't my app,Complaints
Bug found. A whole week if appointments keep disappearing a few hours after I put them in.,Bugs
Very customizable and easy to use. Works great with Google calendar but I can't get it to sync with my office 365 outlook account. Bummer!!,Praises
"I used to love this app but since installing the latest version on my new Samsung 10 the Google Tasks sync has stopped working. It synchronises from Google to Business Calendar but will not synchronise from Business Calendar to Google. ] I have tried disconnecting my Google account and reconnecting, I've made sure BC2 Tasks is associated with my Google account and all Sync settings are turned on. Is this is a known issue and if so will a fix be developed please? Thanks.",Bugs
"Overall i like this app, but i use it to make appointments, and it is very annoying that it won't link the name with the phone number frim the contacts automatically. You can do it manually, but it would be way quicker if it would link it automatically.",Complaints

"Nice widget, and I don't mind a few ads, but persistent ads are annoying. When I get annoyed, I tend to rather go somewhere else, than becoming a paying customer.",Complaints
"Has been one of the best reminder app available for a long time. This most recent update messed up notifications on Android 10. They don't follow the system dark mode at all, instead you have to manually change it in the app or deal with mismatched colors. It looks ridiculous seeing a white notification background amidst other black backgrounds in dark mode. It also looks like the black is not a true black like other apps. If this isn't fixed soon, I'll be looking for a new reminder app.",Crashes
Update on 2016 review - BC still works best. Have Pro version - well worth it. Love the week view which allows you to see EVERYTHING - a must for my appointment driven life. Other calendar apps tried didn't do the week as cleanly or at all. Happy user!,Praises
"Just installed and trying out (I'll update along with my experiences). UI/UX is pleasant and clear. Looks promising. Love the Free full-featured & Premium accessory-features philosophy; I'll pay later on to support development. ISSUES: 1) can't change start-date & repetition of a habit; if it'll break history data, at least allow duplication 2) would expect SCHEDULED days to be colored/marked in the single habit calendar, as future overview; not just as achievement overview. ## So far, good job!",Bugs
"Not interested in people's masterbation habits. The community news feed was 
full of people tracking their jerking off ... no thanks. Don't want to 
know. Uninstalled.",Complaints
I really like this app so far. I've been using it a week now and it does everything I need it to do. I normally use the Astaire bullet journal method with a rolling weekly task list. But im still able to make a weekly task list and assign tasks to certain days. I can also migrate the ones that don't get done. I will certainly keep this app and don't mind the subscription because it works so well for me! I'll check back in again in a few weeks.,Other
A very necessary app. It has changed my life very well. Thanks for creating this app.,Crashes
The update is annoying. I want to add time on the list. But you just add time tag feature which make the time that i put not being displayed.,Complaints
"So far good, it would be really good if the developers added a pause function to the app so that if something comes up during your study or focus period, you can easily pause and come back to where you left of. As the time is just going when other things come into focus.",Praises
"Love the app, it kinda sucks that they moved so much stuff from the free version the the premium version but the premium isn't really expensive so it's ok. The only thing I'm sad about is that the new trees that have been added recently don't change over time. Whether you plant it for half an hour or two hours, it'll end up looking the same. And that sucks cuz letting my tree be more beautiful if I plant one for longer is a motivation factor for me. So I'd like to see that change :)",Crashes
can't edit or change anything,Crashes
"Great app but why do you need 13 Ad trackers in this paid for pro app? Exodus privacy list 13 trackers against your app which is rediculous. Using this every day, but now concerned my every move is being tracked 13 times. Edit: You inform, so that makes it okay then, for you. Perhaps other more privacy focussed users should look elsewhere. How do I confirm the trackers are not used? Trust you, I bet.... 13 are for revenue, 1 will suffice for personalising.",Praises
"Correct idea worng execution. The watch face UI cannont be operated like manually moving clock hands. The time zone stick moves at an interval of 1hr, I wanted to set it at any choosen time and add reminder from there. Big flop was it did not read my calender event and yes I did give necessary permission. phone - one plus 7 OS build- Oxygen OS 9.5.5 GM57AA Further Action- Uninstalling Outlook- Would like to try it post improvement",Complaints
Very useful app but need alram feature too,Other
Edit: This one complaint has been fixed! Its perfect now I really love this app and I use it everyday! The new black and orange theme is really nice to look at! My only feedback is that I wish the color of the widget changed to match the chosen in-app theme because the yellow list kinda sticks out from my background. Other than that the app is perfect! Thank a lot Levor!!,Crashes
I like it but I do wish they could have alarms or reminders or something,Other
Seems like there is a bug when trying to sync my notes to my dropbox account. Would give you 5 stars if fixed.,Bugs
"The motivation pics stopped at some level and dont want to be changed, pls solve this issue",Bugs
"This app is great! But i have some suggestions that would even better improve the quality of using the app. for example, something like being able to edit the tasks widgets to show 'due soon' instead of just tasks for that day for even better planning.",Praises
"Decent app. Fun concept. Biggest issue right now is that some of the dailies that are supposed to be once per week are still showing up as an every-day task, which is very annoying. Sometimes the dailies will cross over into the to-do list for an hour or so at a time, too.",Bugs
So far so good... bit expensive having to purchase a yearly basis to access basic functions as color tags and what comes with it. Translation to Greek is not fluent for the price tag / annually I would apprechiate developers look closer at them. Will give it a try before committing on purchasing it per year. On a positive note love the widget (using however nova launcher). Current rating will change based on the experience.,Crashes
"This app is horrible it was working well at first but when I tried to edit my list titles and add more lists but, it never worked no matter how many times I tried, and trust me that was many, many times. This app is very annoying and over all very useless.",Complaints
So far so good! Great app!,Praises
"I started getting notifications but all came at the same time instead of their specified times, so just removed them and no longer use. Biggest feature I would like see fixed is there seem to be issues with using the ""Today"" option for the task list Widget. Sometimes will only show one task and sometimes when I can complete all my tasks, the next day the list doesn't refresh, still says ""All tasks are done!""",Bugs
Was nice but stopped working. Now I can leave the app and do whatever without the tree dying which defeats the purpose. I changed all my settings and even deleted and redownloaded the app.,Crashes

"I love this program could be 5 stars BUT... a task adds Tick Tick to the shared text in the paid version. This not good and means you have to remove it every time! WORSE IS THE Developer response I got below, clearly indicates they do not understand usability issues reported from good users. "" You can remove the TickTick information manually."" REALLY!!! Not a good suggestion for a productivity product.",Bugs
Task sync with google calendar not working,Complaints
"I had the same problem where I started this app in the middle of intense projects and moving so I fell a couple days behind. Unfortunately skipping dozens of tasks was too time consuming and I don't like leaving a bunch overdue. I know partly it's my impatience, so I have two stars. The other is it just isn't for me.",Bugs
"It was a bad app it was to challenging and it was so stupid. I would not

I love the app but I personally would love it if I could plant trees with the coins I made. Since I have forest I am a lot more concentrated.,Praises
"Kept crashing, rss feed if my calendar duplication of entries was HUGE and overall it just added to the noise rather than helping.. I'm out.. UPDATE: No I can't send a feedback (with log) as I've already unsubscribed and uninstalled the app.. and that's surely something you can add into functionality if you're really interested in gathering the data",Crashes

"I was pretty pleased with the layout and the weekly view on the paid version, but then I started encountering problems. First of all, I used fb to sign up and I logged out of the app, and I can no longer sign in. It stays loading indefinitely. Also, on the weekly view it showed the incorrect name for the day and kept changing it. It also changed notifications randomly.",Bugs
Very bad,Complaints
Why does the app keep showing server connection lost even though there is no problem with my network or internet server? I can't open the app and refresh it at all.,Bugs
"I'm changing my review from 5 to 2. I'm a pro subscriber and love this app, but latest widget changes for Android are truly terrible. I can't click the todoist icon to get the app open anymore because that's gone, I can't click the reschedule shortcut button anymore because that's also gone, and I can't select multiple tasks to mark done at once via the widget anymore. But hey it's transparent now! Horrible update and I hope the team behind this update sees this review.",Crashes
"Ads are becoming really invasive and you have to wait at least 5s each time before you can skip, see another ad, then come back to the calendar. Not inclined to buy pro with such bad user experience... Edit : And most people use a calendar app once or twice a day, so I guess dev are aiming for maximum ad visibility... I know nothing is free but this is annoying, and it's video ads for silly games. I guess I'll uninstall soon..",Complaints
"Easiest way for me to use Habitica. Simple but motivating. I'm not sure if moving the plus button to the center was a good idea, it covers more of the text of the tasks there. Though it is a easy to forget that you need to pull down on the tasks section to see any changes in inventory/tables.",Crashes
Great app! Works exactly like it says it would.,Praises
"I enjoyed using this app for over the past 2 years to improve my life, even if it was by a little bit. The community is kind and friendly. But I think it would be better if you could filter out what type of guild you want to join. I don't want to spend too much time scrolling down just to find the right guild.",Praises
Can't turn off notifications. It will keep ringing. Idk if I'm missing something. But I love the app but if I cant figure this out might uninstal,Praises
"Awesome App, 1) if you could add undo feature : if we make any changes to the todo unexpectedly and press back then it saves it and we cannot find what was the original memo.",Crashes

"UPDATED: I used to have this rated 4 stars until the most recent update which has issues with website addresses. Now every time you go into a note with a web address it doubles it each time you write anything and exit. PREVIOUS 4 STAR REVIEW: I was an hugh supporter of Listmaster, but they went out of business. This app does even more, except I would like to see some type of an import / export feature using csv files (for file backup).",Bugs
"bad, the reminders not working many times trouble shooting",Complaints
It doesn't sync up with Google Tasks. Not worth the change. Zapier does not work for Android. Zapier only works if you pay the Premium fee plus it only gives the option to add new tasks and complete tasks when integrating with Google Tasks. It does not import current tasks previously created in Google Tasks. There is no way to transfer my 144 tasks from Google to Anydo. And I can't afford $72.00 right off the bat to do it.,Crashes
It is truly amazing app for productivity. I wish to give 5 star but many features are not available in the free version that's the reason I'm giving 4star.,Praises
I like the app so far. Good game changer.,Crashes
"I really like this app and it is definitely a very nice visual way to keep track of time. The one MAJOR issue I keep encountering though is that it does not seem to easily sync with my Google calendar, which is where I have all my daily tasks stored. Edit: after trying a few troubleshooting options (including the FAQ suggestions), I was finally able to get Sectograph to begin syncing again by uninstalling and reinstalling Google calendar. It seems like it was a one-time glitch. Love this app!",Bugs
There is no account sync option. If you uninstall it by mistake do all the hard work again to set up the events and periods.,Complaints
"In a word: clunky. I like the calendar integration, however everything else is basic and clunky. Simply adding a task to a list takes 3 clicks and you CANNOT SET A DATE, TIME, SUBTASKS, OR NOTES UNLESS YOU EXIT OUT OF THE TASK AND GOING BACK TO YOUR LIST. The app is designed to give you as many notifications as it can and constantly advertise the premium version. And whatever you do, DO NOT SIGN UP FOR A FREE TRIAL UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING TO SPEND AN HOUR SEARCHING FOR HOW TO DO SO.",Complaints
"Updating to 4 stars because push notifications are now live.. Not Fully Developed. This app could be great, but in their rush to put it out, the features are highly lacking. No push notifications, you cannot upload stickers, no widget, pretty buggy. I really liked the idea of it, but it needs improvement. I will update to 5 stars if and when these features are added. They did reach out to me to resolve my issues, so I am updating to three stars.",Bugs
This is a very nice app. I loved it. But I am not able to open other spieces of trees. It says upgrade to Pro version...instead you can show some ads instead of paying for it...if this issue is cleared ... I'll change the rating to 5.... It's a request..please look in to it.,Bugs
Will give 5 star if: We can edit a recurring event for today only. Changing recurring event changes all the future event as well. What if I only want to change for today only and keep future as it is? Add options to change subtask position. Like changing position for subtask three to the first subtask.,Crashes

"I love this app and have (almost) been converted to digital rather than a paper planner (and that's purely because I enjoy spending afternoons designing and stickering a paper planner). I love the stickers and the changeable covers. I also love that you can pick 'handwriting.'

"For me, the best app for organizing your life. But some things should be improved though: 1. You can't set Monday as the first day of the week. 2. Having some of your notes appear both in Planned and Tasks and some in Planned but not in Tasks is bewildering. Besides Planned and Tasks there are two more lists - My Day and Important. Why so many overlapping lists? 3. You can't change fixed time for reminder alarm. For example, ""tomorrow"" is always at 9 a.m. You can't change that to, say, 10 a.m. 4. You can't set quick alarm. For example you can't type some note and then tap ""remind me in half an hour"" or in 15 minutes, in two hours etc. There's no such option. 5. You can't insert a photo or voice recording into your reminders. 6. You can't protect your reminders and notes with a password. Anyone can read them.",Crashes

"Edit: the app gets better with every update and I hadn't had any bugs for a while now. I absolutely love how it looks after the latest update - super clean and fresh. 5 stars and many thanks to the hardworking devs. Love habitica.
